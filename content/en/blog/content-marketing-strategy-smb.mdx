Content marketing. You hear about it everywhere. "You need to blog", "Make videos", "Be active on social media". But how do you start as an SMB owner with limited time and budget? In this article, we give you a practical framework.

## What is Content Marketing?

Content marketing is creating and sharing valuable content to attract and engage your target audience. Instead of selling directly, you help your potential customers with information they need.

**The idea:** If you're the expert who helps them, they'll think of you when they're ready to buy.

## Why Does Content Marketing Work?

- **82% of consumers** feel more positive about a company after reading their content
- **Content marketing costs 62% less** than traditional marketing and generates 3x as many leads
- **70% of people** prefer to learn about a company through content rather than advertisements
- **SEO benefits**: Good content improves your Google rankings

## Step 1: Know Your Target Audience

Before you start creating content, you need to know who you're creating it for.

### Creating Customer Personas

Answer these questions for your ideal customer:

**Demographic:**
- Age and gender
- Location
- Job title/role
- Company size (B2B)

**Psychographic:**
- What are their goals?
- What are their frustrations?
- What questions do they have?
- Where do they look for information?

**Behavior:**
- Which social media do they use?
- Do they prefer reading or watching videos?
- When are they online?

### Example Persona

> **Mark, 42, owner of an installation company**
> - Wants to digitally professionalize his business
> - Frustration: no time to delve into websites and marketing
> - Looking for: practical, no-nonsense advice
> - Active: LinkedIn, Google searches
> - Reads: short articles with concrete tips

## Step 2: Define Your Goals

What do you want to achieve with content marketing?

**Possible goals:**
- More website traffic
- Generate more leads
- Demonstrate expertise
- Be found better in Google
- Improve customer service
- Increase brand awareness

**Formulating SMART goals:**

Not: "More visitors to the website"
Better: "25% more organic traffic within 6 months"

Not: "Generate more leads"
Better: "10 completed contact forms per month via blog content"

## Step 3: Choose Your Content Types

You don't have to do everything. Choose what fits your target audience and capacity.

### Blog Articles

**Advantages:**
- Good for SEO
- Shows expertise
- Relatively inexpensive
- Long lifespan

**Disadvantages:**

- Results take time

**Suitable for:** Complex topics, how-to's, thought leadership

### Video

**Advantages:**
- High engagement
- Personal
- Growing channel

**Disadvantages:**
- More expensive to produce
- Requires more planning

**Suitable for:** Demonstrations, testimonials, explanations

### Social Media Posts

**Advantages:**
- Quick to create
- Immediate reach
- Interaction possible

**Disadvantages:**
- Short lifespan
- Algorithm-dependent
- Constant presence needed

**Suitable for:** Updates, tips, behind-the-scenes

### Newsletter

**Advantages:**

## Step 4: Create a Content Calendar

Consistency is more important than volume. Better 1 good article per month than 4 bad ones.

### Determine Your Frequency

**Realistic for SMB:**
- Blog: 1-2x per month
- Social media: 2-3x per week
- Newsletter: 1x per month

### Content Calendar Template

| Week | Blog topic | Social posts | Newsletter |
|------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Write article A | 3 posts | - |
| 2 | Publish article A | 3 posts + promotion | - |
| 3 | Write article B | 3 posts | Send |
| 4 | Publish article B | 3 posts + promotion | - |

### Generating Content Ideas

- **Customer questions**: What do customers often ask?
- **Keyword research**: What does your target audience search for?
- **Competition**: What do they write about?
- **Current events**: What's happening in your industry?
- **Seasons**: What's relevant per season?

## Step 5: Creating Content

### The Basics of a Good Article

1. **Catchy title**: Promises value, sparks curiosity
2. **Strong intro**: Hook the reader in the first 2 sentences
3. **Clear structure**: Headings, subheadings, bullet points
4. **Valuable content**: Solve a problem
5. **Call-to-action**: What should the reader do now?

### Producing Content Efficiently

**Repurposing**: Get more out of one piece of content
- Blog article -> 5 social media posts
- Blog article -> Newsletter item
- Blog article -> Video script
- Multiple blogs -> E-book

**Batching**: Work in blocks
- 1 morning per month: outline all articles
- 1 day per month: write all articles
- 1 hour per week: schedule social media

**Outsourcing**: What can you outsource?
- Copywriting
- Graphic design
- Social media management
- Video editing

## Step 6: Distribution and Promotion

Creating content is only half the job. You also need to distribute it.

### Owned Media (Your Own Channels)

- Email list
- Social media profiles

### Earned Media (Earned Attention)

- Shares and mentions
- Guest blogs
- PR and press releases
- Reviews

### Paid Media (Paid Promotion)

- Social media ads
- Google Ads
- Sponsored content

### 80/20 Rule

Spend 20% of your time creating content and 80% promoting it. Especially in the beginning.

## Step 7: Measure and Optimize

### Key Metrics

**Awareness:**
- Pageviews
- Unique visitors
- Social reach

**Engagement:**
- Time on page
- Bounce rate

Check monthly:

- Where do visitors come from?
- What can we improve?

## Example Content Marketing Plan

**Company:** Local accountant

**Target audience:** Freelancers and small business owners

**Goals:**
- 50% more organic traffic in 12 months

## Common Mistakes

1. **No strategy**: Just creating content without a plan
2. **Too broad**: Writing about everything instead of focusing
3. **Only selling**: Every piece of content is a sales pitch
4. **Inconsistent**: Stopping after 2 months
5. **No promotion**: Publishing content and hoping people find it
6. **Not measuring**: No idea what works

## Getting Started

Content marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. Start small:

1. Define 1 persona
2. Choose 1 content type
3. Plan 3 topics for the coming month
4. Create your first piece of content
5. Actively promote it
6. Measure the results
7. Learn and repeat
