As a local business owner, you want to be found by people in your region. When someone searches for "plumber Amsterdam" or "restaurant near me", you want to be at the top. You achieve this with local SEO. In this article, we explain step by step how.

## What is Local SEO?

Local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is optimizing your online presence so that you are more visible for searches with local intent. These are searches where Google understands that the searcher wants to find something nearby.

**Examples of local searches:**
- "dentist Eindhoven"
- "best pizzeria near me"
- "car dealership open on Sunday Rotterdam"
- "web agency Brabant"

For these searches, Google often shows a map with 3 local businesses (the "Local Pack") above the regular search results. That's where you want to be.

## Why is Local SEO Important?

The numbers speak for themselves:

- 46% of all Google searches have local intent
- 88% of local searches via mobile lead to a visit or phone call within 24 hours
- 78% of local mobile searches result in an offline purchase
- "Near me" searches have increased by 900% in recent years

If you don't invest in local SEO, you're missing a huge stream of potential customers.

## Step 1: Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is the foundation of local SEO. This is the profile that appears in Google Maps and in the Local Pack.

### Claiming and Verifying

1. Go to business.google.com
2. Search for your business or add it
3. Verify that you are the owner (usually via a postcard)

### Complete the Profile

A complete profile ranks better. Fill in everything:

- **Business name**: Exactly as registered (don't add keywords!)
- **Address**: Complete and correct
- **Phone number**: Local number, consistent with your website
- **Website URL**: Link to your homepage or a local landing page
- **Categories**: Main category + relevant subcategories
- **Business hours**: Always keep up-to-date
- **Description**: Max 750 characters, including your location and services
- **Attributes**: All relevant characteristics (wheelchair accessible, wifi, etc.)

### Photos and Videos

Regularly add visual content:

- Exterior of your premises
- Interior / workspace
- Team photos
- Products or services in action
- Logo and cover photo

Businesses with photos receive 42% more directions requests and 35% more clicks to their website.

## Step 2: Collect Reviews

Reviews are essential for local SEO. They influence your ranking and your click-through rate.

### Actively Collecting Reviews

- Ask satisfied customers directly for a review
- Send a follow-up email with a direct link to your Google reviews
- Add a QR code to receipts or business cards
- Train your staff to ask for reviews

### Responding to Reviews

- Respond to ALL reviews, positive and negative
- Thank people for positive reviews
- Handle negative reviews professionally
- Resolve issues and show that you care about feedback

### Creating a Review Link

Make it easy with a direct link:
1. Search for your business in Google
2. Click on "Write a review"
3. Copy the URL and share it

## Step 3: NAP Consistency

NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone. This information must be identical everywhere:

- Your website
- Google Business Profile
- Social media profiles
- Local directories
- Industry associations

**Inconsistencies confuse Google and harm your ranking.**

Wrong:
- "Baker's Mill" vs "The Mill Bakery"
- "Main Street 10" vs "Main St. 10"
- "020-1234567" vs "+31 20 123 4567"

Choose one format and use it everywhere.

## Step 4: Build Local Citations

Register your business with relevant local directories and platforms:

### General Directories
- Google Business Profile (required!)
- Bing Places
- Apple Maps
- Yelp
- Local business directories
- Opening hours websites

### Industry-Specific
- Search for directories in your industry
- Join industry associations
- Chamber of Commerce profiles

### Local Platforms
- Local news sites
- Municipality websites
- Shopping center websites
- Local business clubs

### Check Existing Listings

Your business may already be listed with incorrect information. Search for your business name and claim/correct existing profiles.

## Step 5: Create Local Content

Content with local relevance helps your ranking:

### Local Landing Pages

If you serve multiple areas, create separate pages:
- /plumber-amsterdam
- /plumber-rotterdam
- /plumber-the-hague

Ensure each page has unique content, not just the city name changed.

### Local News and Events

Write about:
- Local events you're involved in
- Sponsorship of local clubs
- Collaboration with other local businesses
- News relevant to your local customers

### Service Area Pages

Describe which areas you serve and why you're active there.

## Step 6: Technical Local SEO

### Schema Markup

Add LocalBusiness schema to your website:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Your Business Name",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "Main Street 10",
    "addressLocality": "Amsterdam",
    "postalCode": "1234 AB",
    "addressCountry": "NL"
  },
  "telephone": "+31201234567",
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00"
}
```

### Mobile-Friendly

Local searches often come from mobile devices. Ensure your website:
- Loads quickly on mobile
- Is easy to read
- Has click-to-call buttons
- Is easy to navigate

### Embed Google Maps

Add a Google Maps widget to your contact page with your exact location.

## Step 7: Local Link Building

Links from local websites are valuable:

- Local news sites
- Local bloggers
- Collaboration partners
- Suppliers
- Customers with websites
- Sponsorship deals
- Local events

Organize or sponsor something local and ask for a link.

## Measuring and Adjusting

Track your local SEO results:

### Google Business Profile Insights
- Search terms you're found for
- Number of views (search vs. maps)
- Actions (website visits, directions, calls)

### Google Analytics
- Traffic from specific regions
- Conversions by location
- Landing page performance

### Google Search Console
- Rankings for local search terms
- Click-through rates
- Impressions

### Review Monitoring
- Number of new reviews
- Average score
- Sentiment analysis

## Common Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

1. **Keywords in business name** - Google penalizes this
2. **Fake addresses** - Don't use a virtual office unless you actually work there
3. **Duplicate listings** - Multiple profiles for the same location
4. **Fake reviews** - Buying or writing them yourself is against the rules
5. **Inconsistent NAP** - Different information in different places
6. **Neglected profiles** - Outdated info damages trust

## Getting Started

Local SEO takes time but delivers a lot. Start today:

1. Claim your Google Business Profile
2. Fill it out 100% with current information
3. Ask your first 5 customers for a review
4. Check your NAP on website and social media
