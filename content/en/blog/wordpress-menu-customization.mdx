A good menu helps visitors easily find what they're looking for. In WordPress, you can fully customize menus. This guide explains how.

## Opening Menus

1. Go to **Appearance** > **Menus**
2. Or via the Customizer: **Appearance** > **Customizer** > **Menus**

## Creating a New Menu

### Step 1: Create Menu

1. Click **Create a new menu**
2. Give the menu a name (e.g., "Main Menu" or "Footer Menu")
3. Click **Create Menu**

### Step 2: Add Items

On the left side, you'll see sources to choose items from:

**Pages:**
1. Check the pages you want to add
2. Click **Add to Menu**

**Posts:**
1. Click on **Posts** to expand
2. Check posts
3. Click **Add to Menu**

**Custom Links:**
1. Click on **Custom Links**
2. Enter the URL
3. Provide link text
4. Click **Add to Menu**

Useful for external links or specific URLs.

**Categories:**
1. Click on **Categories**
2. Check categories
3. Click **Add to Menu**

### Step 3: Arrange Items

Drag items to set the order:

- **Up/down**: Changes the order
- **Indent to the right**: Makes it a submenu item

### Step 4: Choose Menu Location

At the bottom of the page:

1. Check where the menu should appear:
   - Primary Menu (main navigation)
   - Footer Menu
   - Other locations (depending on your theme)

2. Click **Save Menu**

## Editing Menu Items

### Change Name

1. Click the arrow on the right of the menu item
2. Modify **Navigation Label**
3. This is the text visitors will see

### Change URL

For custom links, you can adjust the URL. For pages/posts, it automatically links to the correct location.

### Delete Item

1. Click the arrow to open the item
2. Click **Remove**

## Creating Dropdown Menus

Submenus (dropdowns) are created by indenting items:

### Method 1: Drag

1. Drag the item slightly to the right
2. It shifts under the parent item
3. A line shows the hierarchy

### Method 2: Indent

1. Open the menu item (click the arrow)
2. Use the links **Under [item]** to nest

### Example Structure

```
- Home
- Services
  - Web Design
  - Development
  - Hosting
- About Us
- Contact
```

"Web Design", "Development", and "Hosting" are submenu items of "Services".

## Managing Menu Locations

### Assign Locations

1. Click **Manage Locations** (tab at top)
2. Choose which menu appears where:
   - Primary Menu: [Select menu]
   - Footer Menu: [Select menu]

### Multiple Menus

You can create different menus for different locations:
- Extensive main menu
- Shortened footer menu
- Simple mobile menu

## Advanced Options

### Enable Extra Fields

1. Click **Screen Options** at the top right
2. Check extra options:
   - Link Target (open in new tab)
   - Title Attribute (tooltip)
   - CSS Classes
   - Link Relationship (nofollow)
   - Description

### Open in New Tab

For external links:

1. Enable **Link Target** via Screen Options
2. Open the menu item
3. Check **Open link in a new tab**

### Add CSS Class

For custom styling:

1. Enable **CSS Classes** via Screen Options
2. Open the menu item
3. Enter a class name

You can then style this class in your theme CSS.

### Add Description

For menus that display descriptions (e.g., mega menus):

1. Enable **Description** via Screen Options
2. Open the menu item
3. Enter a short description

Whether this is displayed depends on your theme.

## Mobile Menus

Most themes automatically show a "hamburger" menu on mobile. This uses the same menu but in a compact view.

### Tips for Mobile Menus

- Keep the menu short (max 5-7 main items)
- Ensure submenus don't go too deep (max 2 levels)
- Test on a real phone

### Separate Mobile Navigation

Some themes offer a separate mobile menu location. Check your theme settings.

## Menu via the Customizer

An alternative way to edit menus:

1. Go to **Appearance** > **Customizer**
2. Click on **Menus**
3. Choose a menu to edit
4. You'll see changes live in the preview

### Customizer Advantages

- Live preview of changes
- Easy testing without publishing
- Alternative interface

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I create a menu item that doesn't link anywhere?**
Create a custom link with `#` as the URL. This creates a non-clickable label, useful as a header for a dropdown.

**Can I add icons to menu items?**
Not by default. Options:
- Use a plugin like "Menu Icons by ThemeIsle"
- Add icons via CSS classes
- Some themes have built-in icon support

**The submenu doesn't appear?**
Check:
- Is the item correctly indented?
- Does your theme support dropdown menus?
- Is a plugin conflicting with the menu?

**How do I create a mega menu?**
For extensive dropdown menus with multiple columns:
- Use a plugin like "Max Mega Menu"
- Or check if your theme has mega menu support

**Menu doesn't show after saving?**
- Is the menu assigned to a location?
- Is the cache cleared?
- Is the theme menu in the right place?

## Best Practices for Navigation

### Keep It Simple

- Max 7 items in main menu
- Max 2 levels deep
- Clear, descriptive labels

### Prioritize Important Pages

- Most important items on the left (seen first)
- "Contact" or CTA on the right (fixed position)

### Be Consistent

- Use the same terms as on the pages
- Keep order logical
- Mobile and desktop should feel consistent

### Test with Real Users

- Can they find the most important pages?
- Is the structure logical?
- Does it work on all devices?

## Conclusion

A good menu is crucial for user experience. Take time to plan your navigation before you start building. Test regularly and adjust based on how visitors use your site.
