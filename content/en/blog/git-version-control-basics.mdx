When you have a website built, you often hear about "Git" and "version control". In this guide, we explain what this means and why it matters for your project.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks all changes in code. Compare it to "Track Changes" in Word, but much more powerful.

### The Problem Without Version Control

Without version control, you often see this:
```
website_v1.zip
website_v2.zip
website_v2_final.zip
website_v2_final_REALLY_FINAL.zip
website_v2_final_REALLY_FINAL_2.zip
```

This leads to:
- Confusion about which version is current
- Loss of working code
- Difficulty collaborating
- No idea what changed when

### The Solution: Git

Git automatically tracks:
- Which changes were made
- Who made the change
- When it happened
- Why it changed (via commit messages)

## How Git Works

### Repository (Repo)

A repository is the "container" for your project. It contains:
- All files of your website
- The complete history of changes
- Configuration and metadata

### Commits

A commit is a "snapshot" of your code at a specific moment:

```
Commit: "Add contact form"
Date: January 15, 2025
Author: Developer
Changes:
  - New: contact.tsx
  - Modified: navigation.tsx
```

### Branches

Branches are parallel versions of your code:

```
main (production)
├── feature/new-design
├── feature/contact-form
└── bugfix/menu-issue
```

**Benefits:**
- Work on features without affecting the live site
- Test changes in isolation
- Multiple developers can work in parallel

### Merging

When a feature is ready, the branch is "merged" into main:

1. Feature developed in separate branch
2. Code review by team
3. Tests run automatically
4. Merge to main
5. Deploy to production

## Why Git Matters for Your Website

### 1. Safety

**Never lose work again:**
- Every change is saved
- Restore to any previous version possible
- Backup of complete history

**Example:** Developer accidentally breaks the homepage. With one command, the previous working version is restored.

### 2. Collaboration

**Multiple developers simultaneously:**
- Each works in their own branch
- No conflicts from simultaneous work
- Code review before changes go live

### 3. Transparency

**Complete audit trail:**
- See exactly what changed when
- Understand why decisions were made
- Accountability for all changes

### 4. Professionalism

**Industry standard:**
- Every serious development team uses Git
- Required for modern development practices
- Integration with all tools and platforms

### 5. Deployment

**Automated releases:**
- Push to Git triggers automatic deployment
- Rollback possible if problems occur
- Staging environments for testing

## GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

These are platforms that provide Git hosting with extra features:

### GitHub (most popular)

- Owned by Microsoft
- Largest community
- Excellent for open source
- GitHub Actions for automation

### GitLab

- Self-hosting possible
- Built-in CI/CD
- Popular with enterprises
- All-in-one platform

### Bitbucket

- Owned by Atlassian
- Integration with Jira
- Good for small teams
- Free private repos

## Git Workflow in Practice

### Standard Development Workflow

1. **Developer creates feature branch**
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/new-services-page
   ```

2. **Changes are made**
   - Write code
   - Test
   - Make commits with clear descriptions

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Describe what changed
   - Link to ticket/task
   - Request review

4. **Code Review**
   - Colleague reviews the code
   - Feedback and suggestions
   - Approval or adjustments

5. **Merge and Deploy**
   - Code goes to main branch
   - Automatic deployment to staging
   - After approval to production

### Hotfix Workflow

For urgent bug fixes:

1. Branch directly from production
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Expedited review
4. Deploy directly to production
5. Later merge to development branch

## What to Ask Your Developer

### At Project Start

- "Do you use Git for version control?"
- "On which platform is the code hosted?"
- "Do I have access to the repository?"

### During Development

- "Can I see the commit history?"
- "What does your code review process look like?"
- "How are features tested before deployment?"

### At Delivery

- "Do I get ownership of the repository?"
- "Is the complete history available?"
- "How can I give future developers access?"

## Code Ownership

### Why This Matters

You must own:
- The repository with all code
- The complete commit history
- All branches and versions

### Red Flags

**Watch out if an agency:**
- Does not want to give Git access
- Only delivers code as ZIP
- Says version control is "not needed"

### Transfer at End of Collaboration

Make sure you receive:
1. Full access to repository
2. Ownership transfer
3. Documentation of the setup
4. Deployment instructions

## Git for Non-Developers

### You Do Not Need to Learn Git

As a website owner, you do not need to use Git. But do understand:
- That your developer uses it
- That you have the right to the code
- That it ensures quality

### When You Will See Git

You encounter Git when:
- Viewing project progress
- Approving changes (via GitHub/GitLab interface)
- Transfer to new developer

### The GitHub Interface

GitHub offers a user-friendly web interface:
- View files without technical knowledge
- See change history
- Read commit descriptions
- View pull requests

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Git free?**
Yes, Git itself is free open-source software. Platforms like GitHub have free tiers for most projects.

**What if my developer does not use Git?**
This is a red flag. Professional development without version control is risky. Ask why not and consider another party.

**Can I put my existing website in Git?**
Yes, any codebase can go into Git. A developer can take the current state as a starting point.

**How long is the history kept?**
Indefinitely, unless deliberately deleted. The complete history from the first commit remains available.

**Is my code safe on GitHub?**
Private repositories are only accessible to authorized users. GitHub has enterprise-grade security.

## Conclusion

Git and version control are fundamental to professional web development. As a client, you should:

1. **Require** that Git is used
2. **Have access** to the repository
3. **Own** all code
4. **Understand** that this protects you

A developer who does not use Git or does not want to give access is not a professional partner.
