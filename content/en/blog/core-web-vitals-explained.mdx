Core Web Vitals are Google's way of measuring the user experience of a website. Since 2021, they have officially been a ranking factor. The better you score, the more favorably Google treats you. But what exactly do they measure?

## What are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals are three specific metrics that together measure the loading experience of a web page:

1. **LCP** - Largest Contentful Paint (loading speed)
2. **INP** - Interaction to Next Paint (interactivity)
3. **CLS** - Cumulative Layout Shift (visual stability)

*Note: INP replaced FID (First Input Delay) in March 2024*

## LCP: Largest Contentful Paint

### What does it measure?

LCP measures how long it takes for the largest visible element on the page to load. This is usually:

- A hero image
- A large text block
- A video thumbnail

It is about what the user **sees**, not what is technically loading.

### What are good scores?

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| ≤ 2.5 sec | Good |
| 2.5 - 4 sec | Needs Improvement |
| > 4 sec | Poor |

### How to improve LCP?

**Optimize server response time:**
- Choose faster hosting
- Use a CDN
- Implement caching

**Eliminate render-blocking resources:**
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Inline critical CSS
- Preload important resources

**Optimize images:**
- Compress images
- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Specify width and height attributes

**Optimize fonts:**
- Host fonts locally
- Use font-display: swap
- Preload important fonts

## INP: Interaction to Next Paint

### What does it measure?

INP measures how quickly the website responds to user interactions. It looks at all interactions during a visit (clicks, taps, keystrokes) and reports the worst experience.

This replaces FID, which only measured the first interaction.

### What are good scores?

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| ≤ 200 ms | Good |
| 200 - 500 ms | Needs Improvement |
| > 500 ms | Poor |

### How to improve INP?

**Optimize JavaScript:**
- Break up long tasks
- Defer non-essential scripts
- Use web workers for heavy tasks
- Remove unused code

**Limit third-party scripts:**
- Audit all external scripts
- Load them async or defer
- Consider alternatives

**Optimize event handlers:**
- Use throttling/debouncing
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Optimize event listeners

## CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift

### What does it measure?

CLS measures how much the page "jumps" during loading. You know the scenario: you want to click a link, but suddenly everything shifts because an ad loads, and you click on the wrong thing.

### What are good scores?

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| ≤ 0.1 | Good |
| 0.1 - 0.25 | Needs Improvement |
| > 0.25 | Poor |

### How to improve CLS?

**Specify dimensions:**
- Always give width and height to images
- Use aspect-ratio for responsive images
- Reserve space for embeds

**Fonts:**
- Use font-display: optional or swap
- Match fallback font to webfont
- Preload important fonts

**Ads and embeds:**
- Reserve space for ads
- Use placeholders
- Do not load dynamically above existing content

**Animations:**
- Only animate transform and opacity
- Avoid layout-triggering properties
- Use will-change sparingly

## How to measure Core Web Vitals?

### Field data (real users)

**Google Search Console:**
- Core Web Vitals report
- Provides overview of all pages
- Shows trends over time

**PageSpeed Insights:**
- Uses Chrome User Experience Report
- Real data from Chrome users
- Free to use

**Web Vitals JavaScript library:**
- Measure in your own analytics
- Real-user monitoring

### Lab data (simulated)

**Lighthouse:**
- Built into Chrome DevTools
- Provides specific advice
- Simulation, not real users

**WebPageTest:**
- Extensive test options
- Filmstrip of loading
- Waterfall analysis

### Difference between field vs lab

- **Field data** is what Google uses for rankings
- **Lab data** is useful for debugging
- Scores can differ (lab vs real world)

## Impact on SEO

### Direct ranking factor

Core Web Vitals are one of many ranking factors. Google has stated that content relevance is still more important, but with equal relevance, the faster site wins.

### Page Experience signals

Core Web Vitals are part of broader Page Experience signals:

- Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS)
- Mobile-friendliness
- HTTPS
- No intrusive interstitials

### Practical impact

**For competitive keywords:**
If you and a competitor have comparable content, better Core Web Vitals can make the difference.

**For local search results:**
Google only shows sites with good experience in the 3-pack.

**In Google Discover:**
Poor Core Web Vitals can exclude you from Discover.

## Setting priorities

Not all pages are equally important. Focus first on:

1. **Homepage** - Often most visited
2. **Landing pages** - Where campaigns land
3. **Product pages** - Critical for conversion
4. **Blog posts with high traffic** - High volume

### Gradual improvement

You do not need to fix everything at once:

1. Measure your current status
2. Identify the biggest problems
3. Fix the easy wins first
4. Measure again
5. Address the next issues

## Common issues and solutions

### Issue: Slow LCP due to large hero image

**Solution:**
```html
<img
  src="hero.webp"
  width="1200"
  height="600"
  fetchpriority="high"
  alt="Hero"
/>
```

### Issue: CLS from late font loading

**Solution:**
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('font.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

### Issue: Poor INP due to heavy JavaScript

**Solution:**
- Split code with dynamic imports
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize event handlers

## Tools that help

- **Squoosh**: Image compression
- **SVGOMG**: SVG optimization
- **Bundlephobia**: Check npm package size
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated testing
- **Calibre/SpeedCurve**: Monitoring over time

## Conclusion

Core Web Vitals are not just metrics - they measure real user experience. A fast, stable website is better for your visitors and for your rankings.

Start by measuring, identify your biggest problems, and tackle them one by one. Perfection is not necessary; improvement is.
