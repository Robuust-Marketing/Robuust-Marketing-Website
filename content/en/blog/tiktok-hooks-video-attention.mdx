## The 3-second rule

You have exactly 3 seconds to grab your viewer's attention. Scrolling through TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts? Then you know how quickly you scroll past a boring opening yourself.

Research from TikTok for Business confirms this: **63% of the best-performing videos capture attention within 3 seconds**. The average viewer decides within just 2 seconds whether to keep watching.

This article gives you proven hook formulas that work for any type of business.

## What is a hook?

A hook is the opening line or action of your video that convinces the viewer to keep watching. It's the "door" to your content. A strong hook:

- **Sparks curiosity** - the viewer wants to know how it ends
- **Promises value** - there's something to learn or gain
- **Speaks to the right audience** - irrelevant viewers scroll past
- **Matches the rest of your video** - you must deliver on your promise

## The 4 hook formulas that always work

### 1. The Bold Statement Hook

Open with a daring statement that challenges conventional thinking.

**Examples:**
- "Everything you know about Instagram is wrong"
- "This is why you should never post more than 3 times a week"
- "Hashtags are dead. Here's what actually works"

**Why it works:** It creates cognitive dissonance. The viewer wants to know if your claim is true.

### 2. The Question Hook

Ask a question that directly addresses your target audience.

**Examples:**
- "Why do some videos go viral with 200 views while others die at 20,000?"
- "Have you ever wondered why your posts get no engagement?"
- "Did you know that 75% of TikTok videos are watched without sound?"

**Important:** The question must be specific and not answerable with yes/no.

### 3. The Pattern Interrupt Hook

Use unexpected visuals, sounds, or movements to break the scrolling rhythm.

**Examples:**
- Start with a close-up of an unexpected object, then zoom out
- Begin with a loud clap or sound
- Drop something or throw something into frame

**Note:** The interrupt must connect to the rest of your content, or the viewer will still drop off.

### 4. The Proof-First Hook

Lead with results or proof before explaining what the video is about.

**Examples:**
- "This is how I grew from 0 to 50,000 followers in 90 days"
- "This one adjustment doubled my engagement"
- "After applying this tip, my revenue increased by 40%"

**Why it works:** You build authority immediately and give the viewer a reason to invest in your story.

## 20 ready-to-use hook templates

Copy and adapt these for your own content:

### Sparking curiosity
1. "If you're seeing this, it's no coincidence..."
2. "You won't believe what happened when..."
3. "Only 1% of people know this about..."
4. "This is what they don't tell you about..."
5. "Here's a secret I've kept hidden for a long time..."

### Direct addressing
6. "If you're a [target audience], stop scrolling!"
7. "This is for everyone struggling with..."
8. "Before you [action], watch this first"
9. "If you have [problem], this is for you"
10. "Attention [target audience]: this changes everything"

### Promising value
11. "Here's the best way to..."
12. "In 60 seconds you'll learn..."
13. "This is what I wish I knew before I started..."
14. "5 things that guarantee [result]"
15. "The number 1 mistake that [target audience] makes"

### Showing results
16. "This is how I did this in [short time]"
17. "Here's what happened when I..."
18. "Check out this transformation"
19. "From [bad situation] to [good situation]"
20. "This one thing changed everything for me"

## Hooks for B2B and business content

Think TikTok is only for B2C? B2B leads via TikTok cost **60-70% less than via LinkedIn**. The trick is in the right hook.

### Dog Whistle Hooks

Use specific terms that only your ideal customer understands:

- "If you run a SaaS company with over $1M ARR, stop scrolling"
- "This is for marketing managers tired of bad agencies"
- "Every business owner with staff needs to know this"

**Why it works:** You automatically filter out the wrong viewers and speak directly to your target audience.

### Pain-First Hooks

Start with the pain point, not your solution:

- "If your close takes longer than 5 days, you're losing money"
- "If your CRM reporting takes hours, you're being lied to"
- "Everyone tells you X. That's wrong, and here's why"

### Examples by industry

| Industry | Hook example |
|----------|--------------|
| Web agency | "90% of websites are missing this one setting" |
| Accountant | "This saves SMBs an average of $3,000 per year" |
| Recruitment | "Why your best candidates drop out after the first interview" |
| Lawyer | "The clause missing from 80% of contracts" |

## Visual and audio hooks

Not every hook is text or speech. Don't forget:

### Visual hooks
- **Phone Down**: Set your phone down, then pick up a product
- **Product Slide**: Slide a product into frame
- **Screen Grab**: Pull something "out of" the screen via editing
- **Multitasking**: Film while doing something else (making coffee, typing)

### Audio hooks
- Use trending sounds that grab attention
- Start with a striking sound or music drop
- Silence can also be a hook as contrast

## Tips for creating strong hooks

### 1. Test multiple hooks per video

Make the same video with 3 different opening lines and see which performs best.

### 2. Make the hook visual too

75% of videos are watched without sound. Make sure your hook also works as captions.

### 3. Keep your promise

A clickbait hook that doesn't deliver leads to poor retention. Your video will then be shown less.

### 4. Use a teleprompter

For a tight opening, it helps to read your first line from a screen.

### 5. Analyze what works

Look at your video statistics. At what second do most viewers drop off? That's where you need to improve.

## Conclusion

The first 3 seconds make or break your video. With the right hook formula:

- **Bold Statement** - challenge existing beliefs
- **Question** - spark curiosity with a specific question
- **Pattern Interrupt** - break the scroll rhythm visually
- **Proof-First** - lead with results

Experiment with the 20 templates from this article, measure what works for your audience, and optimize. Success on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts isn't luck - it's a formula.
