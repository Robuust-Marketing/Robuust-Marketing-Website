> **At Robuust we handle this for you.** All our hosting packages include Cloudflare CDN, fully configured and optimized. Want to manage it yourself or learn how it works? Read on.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) can make your website significantly faster. Cloudflare offers a powerful CDN - and the best news? It is free. In this guide we explain how to configure it optimally.

## What is a CDN?

A CDN is a network of servers distributed across the world. Instead of every visitor fetching content from your single server (perhaps in Amsterdam), the visitor fetches it from the nearest CDN location.

**Without CDN:**
Visitor in Sydney → Server in Amsterdam (250ms+ latency)

**With CDN:**
Visitor in Sydney → CDN edge in Sydney (20ms latency)

### Cloudflare's network

Cloudflare has:
- 310+ datacenters worldwide
- Presence in 120+ countries
- Average < 50ms from 95% of internet users

## Activating Cloudflare for your website

### Step 1: Create an account

1. Go to cloudflare.com
2. Create a free account
3. Click "Add a Site"
4. Enter your domain name

### Step 2: Import DNS

Cloudflare scans your existing DNS records and imports them automatically. Check:

- Are all records imported?
- Are the correct records set to "Proxied" (orange cloud)?
- Are mail records set to "DNS only" (grey cloud)?

### Step 3: Change nameservers

Cloudflare gives you two nameservers:
```
ada.ns.cloudflare.com
bert.ns.cloudflare.com
```

Change these at your domain registrar. This can take 24-48 hours to propagate.

### Step 4: Wait for activation

Cloudflare automatically checks if the nameservers have been updated. You will receive an email when your site is active.

## Optimizing caching

### What gets cached?

By default, Cloudflare only caches static files:

- Images (jpg, png, gif, webp, svg, ico)
- Stylesheets (css)
- JavaScript (js)
- Fonts (woff, woff2, ttf, eot)
- Documents (pdf)

HTML is NOT cached by default.

### Browser Cache TTL

How long browsers keep files locally:

1. Go to Caching → Configuration
2. Set Browser Cache TTL
3. Recommended: 4 hours for dynamic sites, 1 year for static assets

### Edge Cache TTL

How long Cloudflare stores content:

**Via Page Rules:**
```
URL: example.com/*.jpg
Edge Cache TTL: 1 month
```

**Via Cache-Control headers** (better):
Your server sends headers:
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
```

### HTML caching

Want to cache HTML too? This can provide significant performance gains, but be careful with dynamic content.

**Option 1: Page Rules**
```
URL: example.com/static-page/*
Cache Level: Cache Everything
Edge Cache TTL: 1 day
```

**Option 2: Cache Rules (newer)**
More flexibility and control via Caching → Cache Rules.

### Bypass for dynamic pages

Make sure you do NOT cache these pages:

- Admin/dashboard (/wp-admin/*, /admin/*)
- Checkout/cart pages
- User-specific content
- API endpoints with auth

## Performance features

### Auto Minify

Automatically shrink HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

1. Go to Speed → Optimization
2. Enable Auto Minify for CSS, JS and HTML

**Note:** Always test after enabling. Some scripts may break.

### Brotli compression

Brotli is more effective than gzip:

1. Speed → Optimization → Content Optimization
2. Enable Brotli

This is on by default - check if it is active.

### Rocket Loader

Optimizes JavaScript loading:

- Loads JS asynchronously
- Prevents render-blocking
- Can provide significant speed boost

**Warning:** May break JavaScript functionality. Test thoroughly.

### Polish (Pro plan)

Automatic image optimization:

- Lossless compression
- Lossy compression (more aggressive)
- WebP conversion

Only available in paid plans.

### Mirage (Pro plan)

Lazy loading for images:

- Loads placeholder first
- Full image on scroll
- Improves mobile performance

### HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

Cloudflare automatically supports:

- **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing, header compression
- **HTTP/3**: QUIC protocol, even faster

No configuration needed - works automatically.

## Image optimization (free alternatives)

In the free plan you can optimize images with:

### Cloudflare Images (paid)

- Resize on-the-fly
- Format conversion
- Optimization

### Alternative: Image CDN

External services you can combine with Cloudflare:

- **imgix**
- **Cloudinary**
- **ImageKit**

### On your server

Optimize images before uploading:

- TinyPNG/TinyJPG
- Squoosh
- ImageOptim

## Measuring performance

### Cloudflare Analytics

Go to Analytics → Traffic:

- Requests served by Cloudflare
- Bandwidth saved
- Cached vs uncached requests

### Cache hit ratio

Aim for > 90% cache hit ratio for static content.

Go to Caching → Analytics:
- See cache hit/miss/expired ratio
- Identify uncached resources

### Speed test tools

Measure your actual speed:

- **PageSpeed Insights**: Google's tool
- **GTmetrix**: Comprehensive analysis
- **WebPageTest**: Professional tests

Measure BEFORE and AFTER Cloudflare to see the difference.

## Troubleshooting

### Content is not being cached

Check:

1. **Proxy status**: Is the orange cloud on?
2. **Cache-Control header**: No no-cache or private?
3. **Set-Cookie header**: Present? Prevents caching
4. **Query strings**: Can affect caching

### Outdated content

Visitors see old version:

1. **Purge cache**: Caching → Configuration → Purge Cache
2. **Development Mode**: Temporarily disable caching
3. **Cache-busting**: Add version parameter to URLs

### Website has become slower

Possible causes:

- Server is far away, no cache hits
- Misconfiguration of settings
- SSL mode not optimal

Check:
- SSL/TLS is set to Full (Strict)
- Server location vs visitors
- Cache analytics for hits/misses

## Advanced: Workers

Cloudflare Workers are serverless functions on the edge:

**Capabilities:**
- Custom caching logic
- A/B testing
- Redirects
- Header manipulation

**Example: Cache HTML for anonymous visitors**
```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Check for cookies indicating auth
  if (request.headers.get('Cookie')?.includes('logged_in=')) {
    // Don't cache for logged-in users
    return fetch(request)
  }

  // Cache for anonymous visitors
  return fetch(request, {
    cf: {
      cacheTtl: 3600,
      cacheEverything: true
    }
  })
}
```

## Checklist: optimal configuration

- [ ] SSL/TLS on Full (Strict)
- [ ] Browser Cache TTL configured
- [ ] Auto Minify active
- [ ] Brotli on
- [ ] Static assets proxied
- [ ] Page rules for caching
- [ ] Admin/dynamic pages bypassed
- [ ] Performance measured
- [ ] Cache hit ratio checked

## Conclusion

Cloudflare's free CDN can make your website significantly faster. The basic setup is simple, but the real gains come from optimizing caching.

Start with the basics, measure your results, and optimize step by step. When in doubt: always test thoroughly before activating features in production.
