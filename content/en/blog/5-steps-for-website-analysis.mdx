## Why a Website Analysis?

A website that looks good is not necessarily a website that performs well. To know where you stand and what you can improve, a thorough analysis is necessary.

## Step 1: Analyze Your Speed

The speed of your website is crucial. Visitors expect a page to load within 3 seconds. Taking longer? Then they leave.

**Tools to use:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest

**What to pay attention to:**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5 seconds
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100 milliseconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

## Step 2: Check Your Mobile Display

More than 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. Your website must therefore work perfectly on smartphones.

**Check:**
- Is all text readable without zooming?
- Are buttons large enough to tap?
- Does the mobile version load fast enough?

## Step 3: Review Your Analytics

Google Analytics tells you how visitors behave on your website.

**Important metrics:**
- **Bounce rate**: How many visitors leave the site immediately?
- **Average session duration**: How long do people stay?
- **Pages per session**: How many pages do they view?
- **Conversion rate**: How many visitors become customers?

## Step 4: Test Your SEO

Without good SEO, your website will not be found.

**Check these points:**
- Does every page have a unique title and meta description?
- Are your URLs readable and logical?
- Do you use heading tags correctly (H1, H2, H3)?
- Do you have an XML sitemap?

## Step 5: Evaluate the User Experience

Ultimately, everything revolves around the user.

**Ask yourself these questions:**
- Is it clear what the company does?
- Can a visitor find what they are looking for within 3 clicks?
- Is contact information easy to find?
- Do all forms work correctly?

## Create an Action Plan

After your analysis, you will probably have a list of improvements. Prioritize these based on:

1. **Impact**: What delivers the greatest improvement?
2. **Effort**: What does it cost to implement?
3. **Urgency**: Are there critical issues?

## Conclusion

A website analysis is not a one-time action but something you should do regularly. This way, you stay informed about performance and can make timely adjustments.
