You've invested in a beautiful website. It's online, looks good, and does what it's supposed to do. Done, right? Unfortunately not. Just like a car, your website needs regular maintenance to function properly. In this article, we explain why.

## The Danger of Neglect

A website without maintenance is like a house you don't maintain. At first you don't notice much, but over time:

- Security vulnerabilities emerge
- The website becomes slower
- Certain functions stop working
- Your position in Google drops
- User experience deteriorates

The result? Fewer visitors, fewer conversions, and ultimately less revenue.

## The 5 Pillars of Website Maintenance

### 1. Security Updates

New security vulnerabilities are discovered every day in software. WordPress, plugins, themes - they're all targets for hackers.

**What can happen without updates:**
- Your website gets hacked
- Malware gets installed
- Customer data gets stolen
- Google blacklists your website
- You have to rebuild your entire website

**What we do:**
- Weekly check for available updates
- Testing updates in a staging environment
- Safely implementing updates
- Monitoring for suspicious activity

### 2. Performance Optimization

Your website's speed changes over time. New content, more images, outdated code - it piles up.

**Impact of a slow website:**
- Higher bounce rate (visitors leave your site)
- Lower conversion
- Worse Google rankings
- Visitor frustration

**What we do:**
- Monthly speed tests
- Database optimization
- Cache configuration
- Image compression
- Code optimization where needed

### 3. Backups

Imagine: your website crashes, gets hacked, or you accidentally break something. Without a backup, you lose everything.

**A good backup strategy:**
- Daily automatic backups
- Backups at an external location (not on the same server)
- Regularly testing if backups work
- Keeping at least 30 days of history

**What we do:**
- Automatic daily backups
- Storage on secure external servers
- Monthly restore tests
- Quick restore when problems occur

### 4. Uptime Monitoring

Your website must be accessible 24/7. But servers can fail, SSL certificates can expire, and databases can crash.

**Without monitoring:**
- You don't know your website is offline
- Customers can't reach you
- You miss potential sales
- Your reputation suffers

**What we do:**
- 24/7 uptime monitoring
- Automatic alerts when problems occur
- Quick action on downtime
- Monthly uptime reports

### 5. Content and SEO Maintenance

Your website is a living thing. Content becomes outdated, links break, and SEO rules change.

**Regular checks:**
- Fixing broken links
- Updating outdated information
- Implementing new SEO guidelines
- Reviewing and optimizing analytics

## What Does Website Maintenance Cost?

The costs of website maintenance depend on the complexity of your website:

**Basic maintenance (EUR 50-100/month):**
- Implementing updates
- Managing backups
- Basic monitoring

**Extended maintenance (EUR 100-200/month):**
- Everything from basic
- Performance optimization
- Security scans
- Minor adjustments included

**Premium maintenance (EUR 200-500/month):**
- Everything from extended
- Priority support
- Content updates included
- Monthly reports
- Proactive advice

## The Cost of NO Maintenance

What if you don't do maintenance? These are realistic scenarios:

**Recovering a hacked website:** EUR 500 - EUR 3,000
- Cleaning up malware
- Restoring damage
- Removing from Google blacklist
- Reputation damage (priceless)

**Rebuilding website after crash:** EUR 2,000 - EUR 10,000+
- Rebuilding everything without backup
- Weeks without a working website
- Loss of SEO value

**Conversion loss due to slow website:**
- Every extra second of loading time = 7% fewer conversions
- With EUR 10,000/month online revenue = EUR 700/month loss

Maintenance is almost always cheaper than the costs of neglect.
