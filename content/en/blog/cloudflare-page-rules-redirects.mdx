> **At Robuust, we handle this for you.** We configure redirects, caching, and performance settings as part of our hosting services. Want to manage it yourself or learn more? Read on.

Page Rules are one of the most powerful features in Cloudflare. They allow you to set specific behavior per URL pattern: redirects, caching, security settings, and more. In this guide, we explain everything.

## What Are Page Rules?

Page Rules are configurations that only apply to URLs matching a specific pattern. Examples include:

- All URLs starting with /blog/*
- The exact URL example.com/old-page
- Everything under a subdomain: api.example.com/*

You can then set specific actions for those URLs.

## Page Rules vs. New Features

Cloudflare is in the process of replacing Page Rules with specific features:

| Old (Page Rules) | New |
|-----------------|-------|
| Forwarding URL | Redirect Rules |
| Cache Level | Cache Rules |
| Security Level | WAF Custom Rules |

Both still work, but the new features offer more flexibility. We cover both.

## Configuring Page Rules

### Navigating to Page Rules

1. Log in to Cloudflare
2. Select your website
3. Go to Rules > Page Rules

### Free Plan Limit

The free plan includes 3 Page Rules. Need more? Consider:
- Pro plan (20 rules)
- The new Rules features (more free rules)

### URL Matching

Page Rules use wildcard matching:

**Exact URL:**
```
example.com/contact
```

**Wildcard at end:**
```
example.com/blog/*
```
Matches: /blog/, /blog/article, /blog/2025/post

**Wildcard at beginning:**
```
*.example.com/
```
Matches all subdomains

**Combination:**
```
*.example.com/*
```
Matches everything on all subdomains

## Common Page Rules

### 1. WWW to non-WWW Redirect

Redirect all www traffic to non-www:

**URL:** `www.example.com/*`

**Setting:** Forwarding URL (301 Permanent)

**Destination:** `https://example.com/$1`

The `$1` captures everything that the `*` matches.

### 2. Non-WWW to WWW Redirect

The reverse:

**URL:** `example.com/*`

**Setting:** Forwarding URL (301 Permanent)

**Destination:** `https://www.example.com/$1`

### 3. HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

Force HTTPS for everything:

**URL:** `http://*example.com/*`

**Setting:** Forwarding URL (301 Permanent)

**Destination:** `https://$1example.com/$2`

**Or better:** Use "Always Use HTTPS" in SSL/TLS settings.

### 4. Old URL to New

A relocated page:

**URL:** `example.com/old-page`

**Setting:** Forwarding URL (301 Permanent)

**Destination:** `https://example.com/new-page`

### 5. Cache Everything

Fully cache static pages:

**URL:** `example.com/landing/*`

**Settings:**
- Cache Level: Cache Everything
- Edge Cache TTL: 1 month

### 6. Bypass Cache

Don't cache admin area:

**URL:** `example.com/wp-admin/*`

**Settings:**
- Cache Level: Bypass
- Disable Apps (optional)
- Disable Performance (optional)

### 7. Increase Security for Login

Extra protection for login page:

**URL:** `example.com/wp-login.php`

**Settings:**
- Security Level: High
- Browser Integrity Check: On

### 8. Entire Site Under Construction

Temporarily redirect everything:

**URL:** `example.com/*`

**Setting:** Forwarding URL (302 Temporary)

**Destination:** `https://example.com/maintenance.html`

**Note:** Exclude the maintenance page itself!

## Redirect Rules (New Method)

### Why Redirect Rules?

- No limit of 3 rules
- More targeting options
- Better performance
- Free 10 rules

### Configuring Redirect Rules

1. Go to Rules > Redirect Rules
2. Click "Create rule"
3. Configure the rule

### Example: Adding Trailing Slash

**If:**
- URI Path does not end with "/"
- URI Path does not contain "."

**Then redirect to:**
- `concat(http.request.uri.path, "/")`
- Status code: 301

### Example: Subdirectory Redirect

**If:**
- URI Path starts with "/blog"

**Then redirect to:**
- `https://blog.example.com`
- Status code: 301
- Preserve query string: Yes

## Cache Rules (New Method)

### Configuring Cache Rules

1. Go to Caching > Cache Rules
2. Click "Create rule"

### Example: Long Cache for Static Assets

**If:**
- File extension is in ["jpg", "png", "gif", "css", "js"]

**Then:**
- Cache eligibility: Eligible for cache
- Edge TTL: 1 year
- Browser TTL: 1 year

### Example: Don't Cache API Responses

**If:**
- URI Path starts with "/api/"

**Then:**
- Cache eligibility: Bypass cache

## Bulk Redirects

For many redirects (migrations), use Bulk Redirects:

1. Go to Rules > Bulk Redirects
2. Create a Redirect List
3. Upload CSV or add manually

**CSV format:**
```csv
/old-url-1,/new-url-1,301
/old-url-2,/new-url-2,301
/product/123,/products/old-product,301
```

You can have up to 500 redirects per list, 20,000 total.

## Transform Rules

Modify requests or responses without redirect:

### URL Rewrite

Change the URL internally (visitor sees original URL):

**If:**
- URI Path equals "/home"

**Then rewrite to:**
- `/index.html`

### Header Modification

Add or modify headers:

**Add response header:**
- X-Custom-Header: value

**Remove request header:**
- Remove: X-Unwanted-Header

## Troubleshooting

### Redirect Loop

You get ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS:

**Causes:**
1. Rule redirects to URL that also matches
2. SSL Flexible + force HTTPS on server
3. Conflicting rules

**Solution:**
- Check SSL mode (Full Strict)
- Review all Page Rules
- Check server redirects

### Rule Not Working

**Checklist:**
1. Is the order correct? (top one wins)
2. Is the URL pattern correct?
3. Is DNS set to Proxied (orange cloud)?
4. Wait 5 minutes after creation

### Testing Rules

1. Use curl with -I flag:
```bash
curl -I https://example.com/test-url
```

2. Check response headers:
- Location header for redirects
- CF-Cache-Status for caching

3. Browser DevTools:
- Network tab
- Check redirect chain

## Best Practices

### 1. Minimize Page Rules

With only 3 free rules, use them strategically:
- Use "Always Use HTTPS" for HTTPS redirect
- Use Redirect Rules for URL redirects
- Save Page Rules for caching configuration

### 2. Document Your Rules

Keep track of what each rule does and why. Page Rules don't have a description field, so document externally.

### 3. Test Before Production

Test rules on a staging domain or with specific test URLs before applying broadly.

### 4. Mind the Order

Rules are evaluated from top to bottom. The first match wins.

Wrong order:
```
1. example.com/* > Cache Everything
2. example.com/admin/* > Bypass Cache - Never reached!
```

Correct order:
```
1. example.com/admin/* > Bypass Cache
2. example.com/* > Cache Everything
```

### 5. Use 301 vs 302 Correctly

- **301 Permanent**: SEO value is transferred, browsers cache
- **302 Temporary**: No SEO transfer, not cached

Use 301 for permanent moves, 302 for temporary ones.

## Example Configuration

Complete setup for a WordPress site:

**Rule 1:** Bypass admin
```
URL: example.com/wp-admin/*
Actions: Cache Level: Bypass
```

**Rule 2:** Bypass login
```
URL: example.com/wp-login.php
Actions: Cache Level: Bypass, Security Level: High
```

**Rule 3:** Cache content
```
URL: example.com/wp-content/*
Actions: Cache Level: Cache Everything, Edge TTL: 1 month
```

Plus Redirect Rules for:
- WWW to non-WWW
- Old URLs to new

## Conclusion

Page Rules and the newer Rules features give you precise control over how Cloudflare treats your site. Start with the basics - redirects and caching - and build from there.

With the new Redirect Rules and Cache Rules, you have more flexibility than ever, without the limit of 3 Page Rules in the free plan.
