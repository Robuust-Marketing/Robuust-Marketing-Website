One of the most frequently asked questions we receive: "What does a website cost?" The honest answer is: it depends. But that is not very helpful when you need to determine a budget. In this article, we give you a realistic picture of website prices in 2025.

## The Large Price Range Explained

Website prices vary from a few hundred euros to tens of thousands of euros. These large differences are due to:

- **Complexity** of the desired functionality
- **Custom vs. template** approach
- **Quality and experience** of the builder
- **Ongoing costs** for hosting and maintenance

Let us look at the different options.

## Option 1: Do-It-Yourself Website Builders

**Costs: 0 - 500 euros per year**

Platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress.com offer an entry-level model for those who want to do it themselves.

**Advantages:**

- No technical knowledge required

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited possibilities
- Often slow loading times
- Less professional appearance
- Limited SEO capabilities
- Dependency on the platform

**Suitable for:** Hobbies, personal projects, test ideas

## Option 2: Template-Based Website by a Professional

**Costs: 1,500 - 4,000 euros one-time**

A web agency uses an existing template as a base and customizes it to your corporate identity.

**Advantages:**
- Professional end result

**Disadvantages:**

- Limitations from the template
- Sometimes harder to expand

**Suitable for:** Starting entrepreneurs, small businesses with standard requirements

## Option 3: Custom Website

A fully custom-made website without template limitations.

- Longer development time

**Suitable for:** Established SMB companies, businesses with specific requirements

## Option 4: Webshop / E-commerce

**Costs: 4,000 - 25,000+ euros one-time**

A webshop requires additional functionality: product management, shopping cart, payments, inventory management.

**Price factors:**
- Number of products
- Integration with inventory system
- Payment methods
- Shipping options
- Customer accounts and order history

**Suitable for:** Retailers who want to sell online

## Ongoing Costs

In addition to the one-time construction costs, you have ongoing costs:

### Hosting: 10 - 100+ euros per month

- **Shared hosting** (10-25/month): Fine for small websites
- **VPS hosting** (25-75/month): For websites with more traffic
- **Dedicated/managed hosting** (75-200+/month): For critical business websites

### Domain Registration: 10 - 50 euros per year

A .com domain costs around 10-15 euros per year. Special extensions can be more expensive.

### SSL Certificate: 0 - 200 euros per year

Let's Encrypt offers free SSL. For e-commerce or extra validation, you can consider a paid certificate.

### Maintenance: 50 - 300 euros per month

- Security updates
- Plugin/software updates
- Backups
- Monitoring
- Minor adjustments

### Content Updates: Variable

Updating content yourself is often free. If you have this done for you, expect 50-100 euros per hour.

## What Determines the Price?

### 1. Number of Pages

A one-pager is faster to build than a website with 20 pages. More pages means more content, more design, and more development time.

### 2. Functionality

Standard functionality:
- Contact form
- Google Maps integration
- Social media links
- Basic SEO

Extra functionality (additional cost):
- Booking system
- Customer portal
- CRM/ERP integration
- Multilingual support
- Search function
- Newsletter integration

### 3. Design Complexity

- Simple, clean design: standard
- Animations and interaction: +500-2,000 euros
- Custom illustrations: +500-2,000 euros
- Video integration: +300-1,000 euros

### 4. Content Creation

If you provide all texts and images yourself, you save costs. Professional content creation:
- Copywriting: 100-200 euros per page
- Professional photography: 500-2,000 euros
- Stock photos: 10-50 euros per image

### 5. SEO and Marketing

Basic optimization is often included in the price. Extensive SEO work costs extra:
- Keyword research: 300-800 euros
- Content optimization: 100-200 euros per page
- Technical SEO audit: 500-1,500 euros

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

When reviewing quotes, watch for these often-forgotten items:

- **Revision rounds**: How many are included?
- **Training costs**: Do you get CMS instruction?
- **Migration**: Are old content and SEO preserved?
- **Plugin licenses**: Some functionality costs money annually
- **Future adjustments**: What does an extra hour of work cost?

## Our Price Indication

At Robuust Marketing, we maintain transparent prices:

**Solid Start package**: Ideal for starters and small businesses who want to be professionally online.

**Firm Foundation package**: For established businesses that need more functionality and customization.

Both packages include hosting, maintenance, and support. No hidden costs.

## Tips for Comparing Quotes

1. **Compare apples to apples** - Make sure quotes have the same scope
2. **Ask what is not included** - Avoid surprises afterward
3. **Check references** - Review previous work and ask for reviews
4. **Pay attention to ongoing costs** - A low build price with high monthly costs can be more expensive
5. **Ask about the team** - Who will actually build your website?

## Conclusion

A professional website for an SMB business costs an average of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros in 2025, depending on your requirements. Add 100-300 euros per month for hosting and maintenance.

Better to invest a bit more in quality. A cheap website that does not convert or that you need to replace within two years is ultimately more expensive than investing properly from the start.
