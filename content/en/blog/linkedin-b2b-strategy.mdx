| Business intent | High | Low | Low |

## Profile Optimization

### Personal Profile vs. Company Page

**Focus on your personal profile first:**
- Algorithm favors people over companies
- People connect with people
- Higher engagement on personal posts
- Thought leadership builds trust

**Company page for:**
- Official company communication
- Vacancies
- Product/service information
- Brand credibility

### Optimizing Your Personal Profile

#### Profile Photo

**Do's:**
- Professional headshot
- Well lit, sharp
- Friendly expression
- Recent (last 2 years)

**Don'ts:**
- Group photos
- Vacation/casual photos
- Logo as profile photo
- No photo

#### Banner Image

Use your banner strategically:
- Show what you do
- Add a call-to-action
- Branding elements
- Contact information

#### Headline

You have 220 characters. Formula:

```
[What you do] | [For whom] | [Result]
```

**Examples:**

Bad: "Owner at Company X"

Good: "I help SMB entrepreneurs with websites that convert | Founder @ Robuust Marketing"

Good: "B2B Marketing Strategist | 10+ years experience | Helping SaaS companies grow"

#### About Section

Structure:
1. **Hook:** Grab attention (first 2 sentences visible)
2. **Problem:** What problem do you solve?
3. **Solution:** How do you help?
4. **Proof:** Results, experience
5. **CTA:** What should the reader do?

#### Featured Section

Highlight your best content:
- Popular posts
- Articles
- Case studies
- Media mentions
- Website links

### Optimizing Your Company Page

**Essentials:**
- Logo and banner image
- Complete company information
- Fill in specialties
- Call-to-action button
- Regular posts (3-5x per week)

## Content Strategy

### Content Pillars for B2B

Define 3-5 themes:

1. **Expertise:** Sharing knowledge in your field
2. **Insights:** Industry trends and analyses
3. **Process:** How you work, methodology
4. **Results:** Case studies, successes
5. **Personal:** Entrepreneurship, lessons

### Content Formats

#### Text-only Posts

- Best organic reach
- Personal and direct
- Storytelling works well
- Max 3,000 characters (but shorter is often better)

**Format tip:**
```
Hook (first sentence that intrigues)

↓ Empty line for readability

Content in short paragraphs

Bullet points work well:
→ Point 1
→ Point 2
→ Point 3

Conclusion or call-to-action
```

#### Carousel Posts (Document)

- High engagement and saves
- Educational content
- Step-by-step guides
- Swipe = more time on post = algorithm boost

**Tips:**
- First slide = strong hook
- 8-12 slides ideal
- Last slide = CTA
- Use consistent design

#### Video

- Priority in the algorithm
- Native upload (not YouTube links)
- Add subtitles
- 1-3 minutes ideal

#### Polls

- Generate lots of engagement
- Good for market research
- Keep your audience active
- Spark discussions

#### Articles

- Long-form content
- SEO advantage (Google indexes)
- Thought leadership
- Less reach than posts

### Posting Schedule

**Optimal frequency:** 3-5x per week

**Best times:**
- Tuesday through Thursday
- 07:30-08:30 (before work)
- 12:00-13:00 (lunch break)
- 17:00-18:00 (after work)

**Consistency > Frequency:** Better 3x per week consistently than daily with gaps.

## LinkedIn Algorithm

### How It Works

LinkedIn's algorithm tests your post in phases:

1. **First hour:** Post is shown to a small group
2. **Engagement measurement:** Likes, comments, shares, dwell time
3. **Expansion:** Well-performing posts get more reach
4. **Viral phase:** Top content breaks through to 2nd/3rd degree connections

### Algorithm Hacks

**Do's:**
- Respond to all comments (especially first hour)
- Ask questions in your posts
- Tag relevant people (max 3-5)
- Post native content (no external links)
- Engage before and after posting

**Don'ts:**
- External links in the post (put in comments)
- Too many hashtags (3-5 is optimal)
- Editing within the first hour
- Engagement pods (LinkedIn penalizes)

## Lead Generation on LinkedIn

### Organic Lead Generation

#### Content that Converts

1. **Educational posts:** Show expertise
2. **Case studies:** Concrete results
3. **Contrarian views:** Dare to think differently
4. **Personal stories:** Authenticity sells

#### Bio to Action

- Link to lead magnet
- Booking link for calls
- Website with clear CTA

#### DM Strategy

**Warm outreach:**
1. Connect with relevant people
2. Engage with their content
3. Send personalized message
4. Offer value, not direct pitch

**Don't:** Cold pitch in connection request

**Personalized Connection Request:**
```
Hi [name], I saw your post about [topic] -
interesting perspective! As a fellow [role/industry]
I would like to connect. Regards, [your name]
```

### Engagement Routine

**Daily (15-30 min):**
- Check notifications
- Respond to comments on your posts
- Comment on 5-10 posts from others
- Accept/send connection requests

**Weekly:**
- Analyze post performance
- Plan content for the coming week
- Engage with new connections

### Valuable Comments

Not: "Good point!" or "Interesting!"

Instead:
- Add insight
- Share own experience
- Ask follow-up question
- Respectfully offer a different perspective

## Analytics and KPIs

### Metrics to Track

**Reach:**
- Impressions
- Profile views
- Search appearances

**Engagement:**
- Reactions
- Comments
- Shares
- Click-through rate

**Conversion:**
- Connection requests
- DMs
- Website visits
- Leads generated

### SSI Score

LinkedIn's Social Selling Index (0-100):

1. **Establish brand:** Profile completeness
2. **Find people:** Search and connect effectively
3. **Engage insights:** Share valuable content
4. **Build relationships:** Network growth

Check your score: linkedin.com/sales/ssi

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Prioritizing Company Page

Personal profiles get 10x more reach. Focus there first.

### 2. Only Posting

LinkedIn is a network. Engage with others, not just broadcast.

### 3. Too Business/Dry

People connect with people. Share personal stories and lessons.

### 4. Inconsistent

One viral post does not make you visible. Consistency builds authority.

### 5. No CTA

If you do not ask, you do not get. End posts with a clear question or action.

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Optimize your profile (photo, banner, headline, about)
- [ ] Define 3-5 content pillars
- [ ] Plan first 2 weeks of content
- [ ] Set up daily engagement routine
- [ ] Connect with 10 relevant people per week
- [ ] Analyze your metrics weekly
- [ ] Experiment with different formats

## Conclusion

LinkedIn success for B2B comes down to:

1. **Thought leadership:** Share valuable knowledge consistently
2. **Authentic networking:** Build real relationships, not transactions
3. **Patience:** Authority building takes time
4. **Personal branding:** People follow people, not companies

Most results come after 6-12 months of consistent effort. But the leads you generate are higher quality than any other platform.
