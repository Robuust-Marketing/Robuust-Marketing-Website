Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the new standard for website analytics. It completely replaces Universal Analytics and works fundamentally differently. In this beginner's guide, we help you get started.

## What is Google Analytics 4?

GA4 is Google's latest analytics platform. It differs from the old Universal Analytics in important ways:

- **Event-based tracking**: Everything is an event, no longer based on pageviews
- **Cross-platform**: Track users across website and app
- **Privacy-first**: Better prepared for a world without cookies
- **Machine learning**: Automatic insights and predictions
- **New interface**: Completely redesigned reports

## Step 1: Create a GA4 Account

### New Account

1. Go to analytics.google.com
2. Click "Start measuring"
3. Enter your account name (usually your company name)
4. Configure data-sharing settings
5. Click "Next"

### Create Property

1. Enter a property name (usually your website name)
2. Select your timezone and currency
3. Click "Next"
4. Fill in business information
5. Accept the terms

### Set Up Data Stream

1. Choose "Web" as platform
2. Enter your website URL
3. Enter a stream name
4. Enhanced Measurement is on by default (leave it on)
5. Click "Create stream"

You'll now receive a Measurement ID (starts with G-). You'll need this for installation.

## Step 2: Install GA4 on Your Website

There are different ways to install GA4:

### Option A: Google Tag Manager (recommended)

1. Create a Google Tag Manager account
2. Install the GTM container code on your website
3. In GTM: create a new tag
4. Choose "Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration"
5. Enter your Measurement ID
6. Trigger: All Pages
7. Publish the container

### Option B: Directly on Your Website

Add this code in the `<head>` of every page:

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace G-XXXXXXXXXX with your Measurement ID.

### Option C: WordPress Plugins

- **Site Kit by Google**: Official Google plugin
- **MonsterInsights**: Popular analytics plugin
- **GA Google Analytics**: Lightweight option

### Verify Installation

1. Install the Chrome extension "Google Tag Assistant"
2. Visit your website
3. Check if your GA4 tag fires correctly
4. Or: check in GA4 under Realtime if your visit is visible

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Enhanced Measurement

GA4 automatically measures by default:

- Pageviews
- Scrolls (90% of page)
- Outbound clicks
- Site search
- Video engagement
- File downloads

You can toggle these on/off via Admin > Data Streams > your stream > Enhanced measurement.

### Set Data Retention

By default, GA4 stores data for 2 months. Change this:

1. Go to Admin
2. Click on "Data Settings" > "Data Retention"
3. Choose 14 months
4. Turn on "Reset user data on new activity"
5. Save

### Filter Internal Traffic

Prevent your own visits from polluting the data:

1. Admin > Data Streams > your stream
2. Configure tag settings > Define internal traffic
3. Add your IP address(es)
4. Admin > Data Settings > Data Filters
5. Activate the "Internal Traffic" filter

### Link Google Search Console

1. Admin > Property Settings > Product Links
2. Click "Search Console Links"
3. Click "Link"
4. Select your Search Console property
5. Confirm the link

Now you'll see Search Console data in your GA4 reports.

## Step 4: Set Up Conversions

### What is a Conversion?

A conversion is an important action you want to measure. Examples:

- Contact form submitted
- Quote requested
- Purchase made
- Newsletter signup
- Phone number clicked

### Create a Conversion

1. Go to Admin > Events
2. Find the event you want to mark as a conversion
3. Toggle "Mark as conversion" on

Or create a new event:
1. Admin > Events > Create event
2. Give the event a name
3. Set the conditions
4. Mark as conversion

### Example: Contact Form Tracking

If your form has a thank you page:

1. Create event
2. Name: "contact_form_submitted"
3. Condition: page_location contains "/thank-you"
4. Mark as conversion

## Step 5: Understanding the Interface

- Users in the past 7 days

## Key Metrics Explained

### Users vs Sessions

- **Users**: Unique visitors (based on cookies/device)
- **Sessions**: Visit sessions (ends after 30 min inactivity)
- **New users**: First visit ever

### Engagement Metrics

- **Engaged sessions**: Sessions longer than 10 seconds, with conversion, or with 2+ pageviews
- **Engagement rate**: % engaged sessions
- **Average engagement time**: Average time the page was in focus

### Event Count

Number of times a specific event was triggered.

## Tips for Beginners

### Start Simple

You don't need to measure everything right away. Start with:
1. Understanding traffic sources
2. Identifying popular pages
3. Measuring 1-2 important conversions

### Check Regularly

Look at your analytics at least weekly:
- Are there major changes in traffic?
- Are your conversions still working?
- Are there notable trends?

### Make Annotations

Use the annotation feature to mark important moments:
- Campaign launch
- Website change
- External events

### Compare Periods

Always view data compared to a previous period to recognize trends.

### Share with Your Team

Create scheduled reports to automatically send updates to team members.

## Common Mistakes

1. **No conversions set up**: You measure traffic but not what matters
2. **Own traffic not filtered**: Your data gets polluted
3. **Only looking at totals**: Segment by source, device, etc.
4. **Drawing conclusions with little data**: Wait for sufficient volume
5. **Data retention at 2 months**: Change this to 14 months

## Privacy and GDPR

GA4 requires visitor consent in the EU:

- Implement a cookie consent banner
- Only load GA4 after consent
- Anonymize IP addresses (default in GA4)
- Document your data processing in your privacy policy

## Next Steps

Once you master the basics:

1. Learn to work with Explorations
2. Set up audiences for remarketing
3. Link Google Ads for full funnel insight
4. Experiment with custom events
5. Build a custom dashboard
