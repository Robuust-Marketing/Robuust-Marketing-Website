Your website can experience problems at any moment. Without monitoring, you only notice this when customers complain - or worse, when your revenue drops. In this guide, you will learn how to effectively implement website monitoring.

## Why Monitoring is Important

### The Problem

- Average website has 3 hours of downtime per month
- Every minute of downtime costs money and reputation
- Without monitoring, you do not know when problems occur

### The Solution

Monitoring detects problems immediately:
- **Uptime monitoring:** Is your site accessible?
- **Performance monitoring:** How fast does the site load?
- **Error monitoring:** Are errors occurring?
- **Security monitoring:** Are there threats?

## Uptime Monitoring

### What is Uptime?

Uptime is the percentage of time your website is accessible.

| Uptime | Downtime/year | Downtime/month |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 99% | 3.65 days | 7.2 hours |
| 99.9% | 8.76 hours | 43 minutes |
| 99.99% | 52.6 minutes | 4.3 minutes |

### How Does Uptime Monitoring Work?

1. Service checks your site at fixed intervals
2. If no response, this is marked as downtime
3. You receive an alert immediately
4. After recovery, this is also reported
