Sometimes you want to use an existing page or post as a basis for new content. In WordPress, there are multiple ways to do this. We discuss three options: with a plugin, manual copying, and via code.

## Why Duplicate Pages?

Common reasons to duplicate:

- **Reuse template**: Same layout for similar pages
- **Consistent structure**: Product pages or team members
- **A/B testing**: Compare two versions
- **Backup for major changes**: Keep the original
- **Translation preparation**: Base for other language versions

## Method 1: With Plugin (recommended)

The easiest way is with a plugin. We recommend **Duplicate Post** (by Yoast).

### Installation

1. Go to **Plugins** > **Add New**
2. Search for "Duplicate Post"
3. Install the plugin by Yoast
4. Click **Activate**

### Duplicate a Page

After installation, new options appear:

1. Go to **Pages** > **All Pages**
2. Hover over the page you want to copy
3. You'll now see extra options:
   - **Clone**: Creates a direct copy as draft
   - **New Draft**: Opens the editor with a copy
   - **Rewrite & Republish**: For revising a live page

4. Click **Clone** for a quick copy
5. Your copy appears as a draft

### Duplicate a Post

Works identically:

1. Go to **Posts** > **All Posts**
2. Hover over the post
3. Click **Clone** or **New Draft**

### Plugin Settings

Customize what gets copied:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Duplicate Post**
2. Configure:

**What to copy:**
- Title (on)
- Date (off - gets new date)
- Status (draft recommended)
- Slug/permalink (on)
- Excerpt (on)
- Content (on)
- Featured image (on)
- Template (on)
- Categories and tags (as needed)

**Prefix/suffix:**
- Prefix: "Copy of" (optional)
- Suffix: "(copy)" (optional)

**Where to display:**
- Post list (on)
- Edit screen (on)
- Admin bar (as needed)

### Set Permissions

Determine who can duplicate:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Duplicate Post** > **Permissions**
2. Check which user roles can copy
3. Choose which post types (posts, pages, etc.)

## Method 2: Manual Copying

No plugin needed? You can also copy manually.

### Via the Code Editor

1. Open the page/post you want to copy
2. Click the **three dots** at the top right (...)
3. Click **Code Editor** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Alt + M)
4. Select all code (Ctrl/Cmd + A)
5. Copy (Ctrl/Cmd + C)

Now create a new page:

1. Go to **Pages** > **Add New**
2. Switch to **Code Editor**
3. Paste the copied code (Ctrl/Cmd + V)
4. Switch back to **Visual Editor**
5. Adjust the title and content
6. Save as draft

### Note About Manual Copying

This does NOT copy:

- Featured image
- SEO settings
- Categories and tags
- Page attributes (template, order, parent page)
- Custom fields

You'll need to set these manually again.

## Method 3: Via Database (for developers)

For technically proficient users or developers.

### Warning

Never work directly on the live database without a backup. Only use this method if you know what you're doing.

### SQL Query

```sql
-- Step 1: Copy the post
INSERT INTO wp_posts (post_author, post_date, post_date_gmt, post_content,
post_title, post_excerpt, post_status, comment_status, ping_status,
post_password, post_name, to_ping, pinged, post_modified, post_modified_gmt,
post_content_filtered, post_parent, guid, menu_order, post_type, post_mime_type,
comment_count)
SELECT post_author, NOW(), NOW(), post_content,
CONCAT(post_title, ' (copy)'), post_excerpt, 'draft', comment_status,
ping_status, post_password, CONCAT(post_name, '-copy'), to_ping, pinged,
NOW(), NOW(), post_content_filtered, post_parent, '', menu_order, post_type,
post_mime_type, 0
FROM wp_posts
WHERE ID = 123; -- Replace 123 with the original post ID

-- Step 2: Copy the post meta
INSERT INTO wp_postmeta (post_id, meta_key, meta_value)
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID(), meta_key, meta_value
FROM wp_postmeta
WHERE post_id = 123; -- Same original post ID
```

### Via WP-CLI

If you have WP-CLI installed:

```bash
# Install a duplicate plugin via CLI
wp plugin install duplicate-post --activate

# Or export and import
wp post get 123 --format=json > post.json
# Edit post.json (remove ID, adjust title)
wp post create post.json --porcelain
```

## Bulk Duplicating

Need to duplicate many pages at once?

### With Duplicate Post Plugin

1. Go to **Pages** > **All Pages**
2. Select multiple pages with the checkboxes
3. Choose **Bulk Actions** > **Clone**
4. Click **Apply**

### With WP-CLI (developers)

```bash
# Duplicate all pages in a category
for id in $(wp post list --post_type=page --format=ids); do
  wp post create --post_type=page --post_status=draft \
    --post_title="$(wp post get $id --field=post_title) (copy)" \
    --post_content="$(wp post get $id --field=post_content)"
done
```

## After Duplicating

### Checklist for Duplicated Content

After duplicating, don't forget:

- [ ] Adjust **title**
- [ ] Change **URL (slug)** to something unique
- [ ] Check/adjust **featured image**
- [ ] Adjust **SEO title and description**
- [ ] Check **internal links** (do they point to the right page?)
- [ ] Check **date** (if relevant)
- [ ] Check **category/tags**

### Avoiding Duplicate Content

Google doesn't like duplicate content. Make sure:

- Each page has unique content
- The duplicated version differs substantially
- Or one of them is "noindex" while editing

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are images also duplicated?**
The image blocks are copied, but they refer to the same media files. The files themselves are not duplicated.

**Are SEO settings copied?**
With Duplicate Post: yes (if you check that in the settings). Manually: no.

**Can I duplicate WooCommerce products?**
Yes, WooCommerce has a built-in duplicate function. Hover over a product and click "Duplicate".

**Will the published page be affected if I modify the draft?**
No, the copy is a completely separate post. Changes to the copy do not affect the original.

**How do I duplicate only a specific part of a page?**
Select the blocks in the editor, click the three dots, choose "Copy blocks". Paste in the new page.

## Conclusion

For most users, the Duplicate Post plugin is the best option:

- Easy to use
- Configurable what gets copied
- Works with bulk actions
- Free and reliable
