Website security is not a luxury but a necessity. Thousands of websites are hacked daily. In this guide, we cover all the essential security measures for your website.

## Why Security is Important

### The Risks

**When hacked, you can:**
- Lose customer data
- Lose your Google ranking (blacklist)
- Face legal problems (GDPR)
- Damage your reputation
- Lose money

### Who is the Target?

**Everyone.** Hackers use automated tools that scan websites en masse for vulnerabilities. Size does not matter - small sites are often easy targets.

### Most Common Attacks

1. **Brute force:** Guessing passwords
2. **SQL Injection:** Database manipulation
3. **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts
4. **Malware:** Infecting website files
5. **DDoS:** Overwhelming site with traffic

## SSL/HTTPS

### What is SSL?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts the connection between visitor and server. Recognizable by the padlock and https:// in the browser.

### Why is it Required?

- **Security:** Data is encrypted
- **SEO:** Google ranking factor
- **Trust:** Visitors expect it
- **Legal:** Required for forms and payments

### Implementing SSL

**1. Obtain certificate:**
- Let's Encrypt: Free, automated
- Commercial: DV, OV, or EV certificate
- Via Cloudflare: Free edge certificate

**2. Install on server:**
- Most hosts do this automatically
- Verify everything loads via HTTPS

**3. Set up redirect:**
```apache
# .htaccess
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**4. Fix mixed content:**
All resources (images, scripts, styles) must load via HTTPS.

## Strong Passwords

### Password Requirements

**Minimum:**
- 12+ characters
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

**Example:**
```
Bad: welcome123
Good: K9#mP2$nL7@xQ4
Better: Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-42!
```

### Password Manager

Use a password manager:
- **1Password**
- **Bitwarden** (open source)
- **LastPass**

**Benefits:**
- Unique password per site
- Strong generated passwords
- Secure storage
- Autofill functionality

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**What is it?**
Extra verification step besides your password.

**Methods:**
- Authenticator app (recommended)
- SMS code (less secure)
- Hardware key (most secure)

**Implement 2FA for:**
- Website admin panel
- Hosting account
- Domain registrar
- Email account

## WordPress Security

### Basic Measures

**1. Keep everything up-to-date:**
- WordPress core
- Themes
- Plugins

Updates often contain security patches.

**2. Remove unused plugins/themes:**
Inactive code is still a risk.

**3. Change default admin username:**
`admin` is the first thing hackers try.

**4. Hide WordPress version:**
```php
// functions.php
remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');
```

**5. Limit login attempts:**
Install a plugin like "Limit Login Attempts Reloaded"

### Security Plugins

**Recommended options:**

**Wordfence:**
- Firewall
- Malware scanner
- Login security
- Free version available

**Sucuri:**
- Website firewall (paid)
- Malware scanning
- Security hardening

**iThemes Security:**
- Many options
- Beginner-friendly
- Free version available

### Securing wp-config.php

```php
// Generate unique keys via:
// https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
define('AUTH_KEY', 'unique-value');
define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY', 'unique-value');
// etc.

// Change database prefix from wp_
$table_prefix = 'xyz123_';

// Disable file editing
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);

// Turn off debug on production
define('WP_DEBUG', false);
```

### .htaccess Security

```apache
# Protect wp-config.php
<files wp-config.php>
order allow,deny
deny from all
</files>

# Protect .htaccess
<files .htaccess>
order allow,deny
deny from all
</files>

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes

# Block access to sensitive files
<FilesMatch "^.*(error_log|wp-config\.php|php.ini|\.[hH][tT][aApP].*)$">
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```

## Backups

### Why Essential?

Backups are your last resort for:
- Hacks
- Malware infection
- Accidental changes
- Server problems
- Human errors

### Backup Strategy

**3-2-1 Rule:**
- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different media types
- **1** off-site location

### What to Backup?

1. **Database:** All content and settings
2. **Files:** WordPress core, themes, plugins, uploads
3. **Configuration:** .htaccess, wp-config.php

### Backup Frequency

| Site Type | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Static site | Weekly |
| Blog | Daily |
| Online store | Continuous/Hourly |
| High-traffic | Continuous |

### Backup Solutions

**WordPress Plugins:**
- UpdraftPlus (free/paid)
- BackWPup (free)
- VaultPress/Jetpack Backup (paid)

**Server Level:**
- Hosting provider backups
- Server snapshots
- Rsync scripts

**Cloud Storage:**
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Amazon S3
- Backblaze B2

### Test Your Backups

A backup is only reliable if you have tested it:
1. Download the backup
2. Set up in test environment
3. Verify everything works
4. Do this regularly

## Firewall

### Types of Firewalls

**Network Firewall:**
Protects the server at the network level.

**Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
Protects specifically against web attacks.

### WAF Options

**Cloud-based:**
- Cloudflare (free tier available)
- Sucuri (paid)
- AWS WAF

**Plugin-based:**
- Wordfence
- NinjaFirewall

### What a WAF Blocks

- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attacks
- Known malicious IPs
- Bot attacks
- Suspicious request patterns

## Server Security

### Software Updates

Keep up-to-date:
- Operating system
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- PHP version
- Database server

### File Permissions

**Correct permissions:**
```
Directories: 755
Files: 644
wp-config.php: 400 or 440
```

**Check with:**
```bash
find /path/to/wordpress/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /path/to/wordpress/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### Disable Directory Listing

```apache
# .htaccess
Options -Indexes
```

### Security Headers

```apache
# .htaccess
Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';"
```

## Monitoring

### Uptime Monitoring

**Services:**
- UptimeRobot (free)
- Pingdom
- StatusCake

**Set up alerts for:**
- Site down
- Slow response time
- SSL problems

### Security Scanning

**Regularly scan for:**
- Malware
- Outdated software
- Vulnerabilities
- Blacklist status

**Tools:**
- Sucuri SiteCheck (free)
- Google Safe Browsing
- VirusTotal

### Log Monitoring

**Review regularly:**
- Access logs (suspicious traffic)
- Error logs (attack attempts)
- Login logs (brute force detection)

## Incident Response

### If You Have Been Hacked

**Step 1: Isolate**
- Take site offline or in maintenance mode
- Change all passwords
- Revoke all sessions

**Step 2: Analyze**
- When did it happen?
- How did they get in?
- What has been affected?

**Step 3: Clean**
- Restore from clean backup
- Or manually remove malware
- Update all software

**Step 4: Strengthen**
- Fix the vulnerability
- Implement missing security
- Document the incident

**Step 5: Monitor**
- Extra monitoring after incident
- Check for re-infection
- Analyze logs

### In Case of Data Breach

**GDPR requirements:**
- Report within 72 hours to Data Protection Authority
- Inform affected persons if necessary
- Document the incident
