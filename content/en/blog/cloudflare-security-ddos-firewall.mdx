> **At Robuust we handle this for you.** All websites we host are secured with Cloudflare's DDoS protection and firewall. Want to know how it works or do it yourself? Read on.

Every website is a potential target for attacks. From simple brute-force attempts to large-scale DDoS attacks - the threats are real. Cloudflare offers powerful protection, largely for free. In this article we explain how to set it up.

## Why website security is important

The numbers don't lie:

- A cyberattack occurs every 39 seconds
- 43% of attacks target small businesses
- The average cost of a data breach: $4.5 million
- 94% of malware is delivered via email

You might think: "Who would want to attack my small website?" But attacks are often automated and target everyone.

## DDoS protection

### What is a DDoS attack?

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an attack where thousands of computers simultaneously bombard your server with traffic until it crashes.

**Types of DDoS:**
- **Volumetric**: Flooding with data (UDP floods)
- **Protocol**: Abusing network protocols (SYN flood)
- **Application layer**: Legitimate-looking requests (HTTP floods)

### Cloudflare's DDoS protection

Cloudflare absorbs and filters DDoS traffic automatically:

- **>197 Tbps network capacity**: Can absorb virtually any attack
- **Automatic detection**: Machine learning recognizes attack patterns
- **Free included**: Even on the free plan

You don't need to configure anything - it is active by default as soon as your traffic flows through Cloudflare.

### Under Attack Mode

During an active attack you can enable "I'm Under Attack Mode":

1. Go to Security → Overview
2. Click on "Under Attack Mode"
3. This shows a JavaScript challenge to all visitors

**Only use this during active attacks** - it slows down legitimate visitors.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### What does a WAF do?

A WAF protects against application-level attacks:

- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Remote file inclusion
- Local file inclusion
- Common exploits

### Managed rulesets

Cloudflare offers predefined rulesets:

**Cloudflare Managed Ruleset:**
- Protects against known vulnerabilities
- Continuously updated
- Free available (limited)

**OWASP Core Ruleset:**
- Based on OWASP standards
- Protects against top 10 web vulnerabilities
- Available in Pro plan and higher

### Enabling WAF

1. Go to Security → WAF
2. Click on "Managed rules"
3. Enable the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset
4. Review the default action (Block/Challenge)

### Creating custom rules

You can create your own firewall rules:

**Example: Block specific user agent**
```
(http.user_agent contains "BadBot")
→ Block
```

**Example: Challenge requests to login**
```
(http.request.uri.path contains "/wp-login.php")
→ Managed Challenge
```

**Example: Allow only specific country**
```
(ip.geoip.country ne "US")
→ Block
```

## Bot management

### Bad bots vs Good bots

**Good bots:**
- Googlebot (search indexing)
- Bingbot
- Social media crawlers

**Bad bots:**
- Scrapers (content stealing)
- Spambots
- Vulnerability scanners
- Credential stuffers

### Bot Fight Mode

Free bot protection:

1. Go to Security → Bots
2. Enable "Bot Fight Mode"
3. Known bad bots are blocked

### Super Bot Fight Mode (Pro)

More control over bot traffic:

- Allow verified bots
- Challenge automated traffic
- Static resource protection

### Challenge passage

You can set how long a challenge remains valid:

1. Security → Settings
2. Challenge Passage: 30 minutes (default)

Legitimate visitors don't need to continuously re-verify after a challenge.

## IP Access Rules

### Blocking IPs

Block specific IP addresses or ranges:

1. Security → WAF → Tools
2. Click "Create a Firewall Rule"
3. Enter IP or range
4. Choose action: Block

**Example:**
```
Block: 192.168.1.0/24 (entire subnet)
Block: AS12345 (entire ISP/hosting provider)
```

### Whitelisting IPs

Always allow specific IPs:

```
Allow: 198.51.100.1 (your own IP)
Allow: 203.0.113.0/24 (office network)
```

This is useful for:
- Your own IP (prevent lockout)
- Office IPs
- Monitoring services
- Payment providers

### Country blocking

Block traffic from specific countries:

1. Security → WAF → Custom rules
2. Create rule: (ip.geoip.country eq "CN") → Block

**Consider this for:**
- Countries where you have no customers
- Countries with many attacks
- Compliance reasons (GDPR)

## Rate limiting

### What is rate limiting?

Limit the number of requests an IP can make:

- Protects against brute force
- Prevents scraping
- Reduces server load

### Configuring rate limiting

1. Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules
2. Create a new rule:

**Example: Protect login**
```
If: URI Path equals "/wp-login.php"
Then: Block for 10 minutes
When: Exceeds 5 requests per minute
```

**Example: API rate limit**
```
If: URI Path starts with "/api/"
Then: Block for 1 hour
When: Exceeds 100 requests per minute
```

## Page Shield

Protection against supply chain attacks:

- Monitors third-party scripts
- Detects unexpected changes
- Alerts on suspicious activity

1. Go to Security → Page Shield
2. Enable monitoring
3. Review detected scripts
4. Block suspicious scripts

## Logging and monitoring

### Security Events

View all security events:

1. Security → Events
2. Filter by type, action, source
3. Analyze patterns

### Analytics

Security analytics dashboard:

- Blocked requests
- Top attack types
- Geographic distribution
- Trends over time

### Setting up alerts

Get notifications for security events:

1. Notifications
2. Create notification
3. Choose "Security Events Alert"
4. Set thresholds

## SSL/TLS security

### Encryption modes

Choose the right level:

- **Off**: No encryption (NEVER use)
- **Flexible**: Encrypt to Cloudflare, HTTP to origin
- **Full**: Encrypt fully, self-signed OK
- **Full (Strict)**: Encrypt fully, valid cert required (RECOMMENDED)

### Always Use HTTPS

Force HTTPS for all visitors:

1. SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates
2. Enable "Always Use HTTPS"

### HSTS

HTTP Strict Transport Security:

1. SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates
2. Enable HSTS
3. Set max-age (min. 6 months)

**Warning:** HSTS is difficult to reverse. Test thoroughly.

### Minimum TLS version

Block old, insecure TLS versions:

1. SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates
2. Minimum TLS Version: 1.2

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are insecure and should be blocked.

## Security checklist

### Basic (free plan)

- [ ] SSL/TLS on Full (Strict)
- [ ] Always Use HTTPS active
- [ ] Bot Fight Mode on
- [ ] Security Level: Medium
- [ ] Browser Integrity Check on
- [ ] Your own IP whitelisted

### Advanced (Pro plan)

- [ ] WAF managed rulesets active
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Custom firewall rules
- [ ] OWASP ruleset active
- [ ] Security alerts set up

### Expert

- [ ] Page Shield monitoring
- [ ] Zero Trust access for admin
- [ ] API Shield for APIs
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting

## Common mistakes

1. **Origin IP leaks**: Make sure your server IP is not discoverable
2. **Bypass via direct IP**: Block direct access to server
3. **Rules too strict**: Test before production, prevent false positives
4. **Security level too low**: Medium is a good baseline
5. **No monitoring**: Regularly check security events

## Conclusion

Cloudflare offers enterprise-level security for everyone. Even with the free plan you get:

- Unlimited DDoS protection
- Basic WAF protection
- Bot management
- SSL/TLS encryption

Start with the basics, monitor your security events, and gradually add more protection where needed.
