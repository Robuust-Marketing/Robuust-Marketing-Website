A beautiful website is not enough. If visitors can't find what they're looking for or don't understand what to do, you lose customers. In this article, we discuss the 7 most common UX mistakes we encounter on SMB websites.

## What is UX Actually?

UX stands for User Experience. It's about how easy and pleasant it is to use your website. Good UX means visitors:

- Quickly find what they're looking for
- Understand what you offer
- Know what they should do
- Leave with a positive feeling

## Mistake 1: Unclear Navigation

**The problem:**
Visitors click away within an average of 3 seconds if they don't know where to look. A chaotic menu with too many options or vague names causes confusion.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- Menu with more than 7 items at the top level
- Vague names like "Solutions" or "More"
- Dropdown menus with even more submenus
- No clear hierarchy

**The solution:**
- Limit your main menu to 5-7 items
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Most important pages directly accessible
- Consider a mega menu for complex structures
- Test: can someone find what they're looking for in 5 seconds?

## Mistake 2: Too Much Text, Too Little Structure

**The problem:**
Large blocks of text without subheadings, bullets, or visual breaks. Nobody reads that. People scan websites, they don't read them from A to Z.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- Paragraphs longer than 3-4 lines
- No subheadings
- No bullet points or lists
- No images or icons
- Everything equally large and equally important

**The solution:**
- Break up text with clear headings (H2, H3)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- Add relevant images
- Make important words bold
- Use white space

## Mistake 3: Confusing Call-to-Actions

**The problem:**
Too many buttons that all seem equally important. Or the opposite: no clear button to take action.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- Multiple colored buttons next to each other
- Vague text like "Click here" or "More info"
- CTA button hidden at the bottom of the page
- Same button color as the rest of the design

**The solution:**
- One primary CTA per page/section
- Action-oriented language: "Request a quote", "Schedule appointment"
- Contrasting color that stands out
- CTA visible without scrolling
- Repeat the CTA after important sections

## Mistake 4: Poor Mobile Experience

**The problem:**
More than 60% of your visitors come via mobile. A website that only works well on desktop loses the majority of its audience.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- Text too small to read
- Buttons too close together
- Horizontal scrolling required
- Menu doesn't work properly
- Forms impossible to fill out
- Images too large or distorted

**The solution:**
- Design mobile-first
- Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44x44 pixels)
- Readable text without zooming (minimum 16px)
- Vertical scroll direction
- Sticky menu for easy navigation
- Test on real devices, not just in browser tools

## Mistake 5: Slow Loading Times

**The problem:**
A slow website frustrates visitors and costs you Google rankings. And the problem gets worse on mobile with slower connections.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- Loading time above 3 seconds
- Large images that aren't compressed
- Many external scripts and plugins
- No caching set up
- Videos that load automatically

**The solution:**
- Compress images (WebP format)
- Use lazy loading for images
- Minimize plugins and scripts
- Implement caching
- Choose fast hosting
- Measure regularly with PageSpeed Insights

## Mistake 6: Missing Contact Information

**The problem:**
Visitors want to know who they're doing business with. If they can't find or reach you, they go to the competitor.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- No phone number visible
- Contact page hard to find
- Only a contact form, no alternatives
- No address or business details
- No response time indication

**The solution:**
- Phone number in header (clickable on mobile)
- Email address as alternative
- Contact page in main menu
- Physical address if applicable
- Offer multiple contact options
- Set expectations: "Response within 24 hours"

## Mistake 7: No Trust Signals

**The problem:**
People don't do business with companies they don't trust. Without social proof, you start with a disadvantage.

**Recognizable symptoms:**
- No reviews or testimonials
- No client logos
- No trust seals or certifications
- No "About us" page
- Stock photos instead of real photos
- No case studies or portfolio

**The solution:**
- Actively ask customers for reviews
- Show logos of well-known clients
- Add relevant trust seals
- Invest in real photos of team and office
- Write case studies of successful projects
- Create a personal "About us" page

## How Do You Know If Your Website Has UX Problems?

### Use Data

- **Bounce rate** above 70%? Visitors aren't finding what they're looking for
- **Time on site** under 1 minute? Content isn't interesting enough
- **Exit pages**: where do visitors leave?

### Ask for Feedback

- Have 5 people test your website
- Ask: "Can you find X?" and "What would you do here?"
- Watch as they navigate

### Use Tools

- Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity for heatmaps
- Google Analytics for behavioral data
- PageSpeed Insights for speed
- Mobile-Friendly Test from Google

## Quick Wins: Improve Immediately

No time for a major revision? Start with these quick wins:

1. **Phone number in header** - immediately reachable
2. **Choose one clear CTA color** and use it consistently
3. **Compress images** with TinyPNG
4. **Add reviews** to your homepage
5. **Add headings** to long texts

## Conclusion

UX mistakes cost you money. Visitors who can't find what they're looking for leave your website. Those conversions never come back.

The good news: most mistakes are relatively easy to fix. Start with the three biggest pain points and work from there.
