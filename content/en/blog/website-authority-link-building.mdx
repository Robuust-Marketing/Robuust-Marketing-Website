Website authority is one of the most important factors for higher rankings in Google. The more authoritative websites link to your site, the more trustworthy Google considers you. In this guide, you'll learn everything about website authority and how to increase it through link building.

## What is Website Authority?

Website authority is a score that indicates how strong a website's backlink profile is. Different SEO tools use their own metrics:

- <a href="https://ahrefs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Ahrefs**</a> → Domain Rating (DR) on a 0-100 scale
- <a href="https://moz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Moz**</a> → Domain Authority (DA) on a 0-100 scale
- <a href="https://semrush.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**SEMrush**</a> → Authority Score on a 0-100 scale
- <a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Ubersuggest**</a> → Domain Score on a 0-100 scale

**Important:** Google doesn't use these scores directly as a ranking factor. They're third-party indicators that reflect the strength of your backlink profile - which Google *does* consider important.

### How is Authority Calculated?

Take [Ahrefs Domain Rating](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-to-increase-website-authority/) as an example. It's determined by:

1. **Number of referring domains** - How many unique websites link to you?
2. **Authority of linking sites** - Links from stronger sites carry more weight
3. **Link distribution** - The fewer outgoing links a site has, the more "value" each link passes

The scale is logarithmic: going from DR 9 to 10 is much easier than going from DR 69 to 70.

### Why Does Authority Matter?

- **Higher rankings:** Sites with strong backlink profiles rank better
- **Faster indexing:** Google crawls authoritative sites more frequently
- **More trust:** Visitors trust well-known, well-linked sites
- **Competitive advantage:** You won't beat a DR 60 competitor with DR 10

## The Basics: How Link Building Works

### What Makes a Link Valuable?

Not all links are equal. A valuable backlink has:

**1. Relevance**
A link from a related website is more valuable than a random link.

```
✓ Web design agency linked by marketing blog
✓ Restaurant linked by food blogger
✗ Web design agency linked by fitness site
```

**2. Authority**
Links from strong sites pass more "link juice."

**3. Dofollow Attribute**
Only `dofollow` links pass authority. Links with `nofollow`, `ugc`, or `sponsored` attributes aren't counted in DR calculations.

```html
<!-- Passes authority -->
<a href="https://yoursite.com">Link text</a>

<!-- Does NOT pass authority -->
<a href="https://yoursite.com" rel="nofollow">Link text</a>
```

**4. Placement**
- In-content links (within text) are more valuable
- Footer/sidebar links are less valuable
- Links higher on the page may carry more weight

**5. Anchor Text**
The clickable text of the link provides context:

```
✓ "professional web design" (descriptive)
✓ "Robuust Marketing" (brand mention)
○ "click here" (neutral)
✗ "buy cheap SEO services" (over-optimized)
```

### Links to Avoid

Some links can harm your site:

- **Purchased links** - Against Google's guidelines
- **Link farms** - Networks purely for link building
- **PBNs** - Private Blog Networks
- **Spam comments** - Links in blog comments
- **Irrelevant directories** - Low-quality business listings

## Strategy 1: Create Linkable Assets

The best way to earn links is to create content that people *want* to link to.

### Statistics and Research

Original data attracts links. Journalists and bloggers look for reliable sources.

**Examples:**
- "Website statistics Netherlands 2025"
- "E-commerce benchmark report SMB"
- "Average conversion rates by industry"

**Why this works:**
According to [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/increase-domain-authority), 32% of their backlinks come from statistics pages, while these make up only 16% of their content.

### Comprehensive Guides

In-depth, complete guides are often used as references.

**Characteristics of linkable guides:**
- Complete (everything about one topic)
- Well-structured
- Visual elements (infographics, diagrams)
- Regularly updated

### Free Tools and Calculators

Interactive tools attract many links:

- Price calculators
- ROI calculations
- Checklists and templates
- Free audits

### Infographics

Visual content is gladly shared and linked:

- Create unique, valuable infographics
- Provide an embed code
- Actively promote on social media

## Strategy 2: Outreach and PR

### HARO (Help A Reporter Out)

HARO connects journalists with experts. You answer questions and receive a mention with a link in return.

**How it works:**
1. Sign up at [HARO](https://www.helpareporter.com/)
2. Receive daily emails with journalist queries
3. Respond to relevant questions with expertise
4. Earn links from news sites

**Tips for success:**
- Respond quickly (within hours)
- Give concrete, actionable answers
- Include your credentials
- Be concise

### Digital PR

Create newsworthy content:

- **Publish research** - Your own data with interesting insights
- **Industry trends** - Your perspective on developments
- **Expert commentary** - React to current news
- **Local stories** - News relevant to your region

### Guest Posting

Write articles for relevant websites:

**Good guest post characteristics:**
- Relevant website in your niche
- Real readers (not just for links)
- Valuable content
- Natural link to your site

**Where to start:**
- Industry blogs
- Online magazines
- Partner websites
- Local news sites

## Strategy 3: Competitor Analysis

### Backlink Gap Analysis

Discover where competitors have links that you're missing:

**With Ahrefs:**
1. Go to Site Explorer
2. Enter your competitor
3. View Referring Domains
4. Filter by DR and relevance
5. Approach the same sites

**With free tools:**
- Ubersuggest (limited)
- Moz Link Explorer (10 queries/month)

### Skyscraper Technique

1. Find popular content in your niche with many links
2. Create something better (more comprehensive, more current, better designed)
3. Reach out to sites linking to the original
4. Ask if they'd like to link to your improved version

### Broken Link Building

1. Find broken links on relevant websites
2. Create similar content
3. Report the broken link
4. Suggest your content as a replacement

## Strategy 4: Relationships and Partnerships

### Suppliers and Partners

- Ask for listing on partner/client pages
- Give testimonials (often with a link back)
- Collaborate on content

### Local Organizations

- Chamber of Commerce
- Business associations
- BNI and networking clubs
- Industry organizations

### Sponsorships

- Local events
- Sports clubs
- Charities
- Trade shows and conferences

## Strategy 5: Content Distribution

### Content Syndication

Publish content on multiple platforms:

- LinkedIn Articles
- Medium
- Industry platforms
- News aggregators

**Note:** Use canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.

### Social Media Amplification

Social links are usually nofollow, but:

- Increase visibility
- Lead to natural links
- Build brand awareness

### Email Outreach

Share valuable content with relevant contacts:

- Industry experts
- Bloggers in your niche
- Journalists
- Influencers

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Focusing Only on DR

DR is a metric, not a goal. Focus on:
- Links from relevant sites
- Links to pages you want to rank
- Diversity in your backlink profile

### 2. Growing Too Fast

Unnaturally fast link growth is suspicious:
- Build links gradually
- Vary link types
- Avoid patterns

### 3. Only Homepage Links

Distribute links across your site:
- Service pages
- Blog content
- Landing pages

### 4. Anchor Text Over-Optimization

Too many exact-match anchors is a red flag:

```
✗ 90% of links have anchor "web design Rotterdam"
✓ Mix of brand, URL, generic, and descriptive anchors
```

### 5. Link Building Without Good Content

Links to bad content don't convert. First ensure you have:
- Valuable pages
- Good user experience
- Relevant content
