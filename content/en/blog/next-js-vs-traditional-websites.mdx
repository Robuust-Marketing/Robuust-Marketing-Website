When building a new website, choosing the right technology is an important decision. In this guide, we compare Next.js with traditional approaches like WordPress and static HTML.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a modern React framework for building websites and web applications. It combines the power of React with additional features such as:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages are generated on the server
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages are created during the build process
- **Automatic code splitting**: Only necessary code is loaded
- **Built-in optimizations**: Images, fonts, and scripts are automatically optimized

### Benefits of Next.js

**Performance**
- Extremely fast load times through pre-rendering
- Automatic image optimization
- Minimal JavaScript in the browser

**SEO**
- Fully server-rendered HTML
- Metadata management out-of-the-box
- Fast Core Web Vitals scores

**Developer Experience**
- Hot reloading during development
- TypeScript support
- Modular component structure

**Scalability**
- Easy to extend with API routes
- Serverless deployment possible
- No database needed for simple sites

## Traditional Websites

### WordPress

WordPress is the most widely used CMS in the world, with approximately 40% market share.

**Advantages:**
- User-friendly admin panel
- Thousands of themes and plugins
- Large community and support
- No programming knowledge needed for basic use

**Disadvantages:**
- Performance can suffer from plugins
- Security risks with poor maintenance
- Dependent on hosting for speed
- Database required

### Static HTML/CSS

Pure HTML websites are the simplest form of web development.

**Advantages:**
- Maximum control
- No runtime dependencies
- Extremely secure
- Cheap to host

**Disadvantages:**
- No CMS functionality
- Manual maintenance
- Not scalable for large sites
- Harder to update

## When to Choose Next.js?

Next.js is ideal for:

### 1. Performance-critical websites
When load time and Core Web Vitals are crucial for your business:
- E-commerce where every second counts
- News/media websites with high traffic
- Marketing sites where SEO is a priority

### 2. Complex web applications
Sites with interactive features:
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Booking systems
- E-learning platforms

- Companies with multiple markets
- Sites with varying traffic loads

### 4. Development team available

- Technical founder

## When to Choose WordPress?

WordPress remains a good choice for:

### 1. Blog-focused websites
- Personal blogs
- News websites
- Content-heavy sites

### 2. Limited budget
- Small businesses
- Non-profits
- MVPs and prototypes

### 3. Non-technical owner
- When the owner wants to manage content themselves
- No budget for development maintenance
- Quick changes needed

### 4. Known plugin requirements

## Hybrid Approaches

### Headless WordPress + Next.js

- API connection between both

**Advantages:**

## Migration Considerations

2. Build new frontend
3. Set up SEO redirects
4. Testing and launch

### From Next.js to WordPress

Rarely needed, but possible when:
- Team changes
- Budget shrinks
- Simpler needs

## Our Recommendation

At Robuust Marketing, we advise based on your specific situation:

**Choose Next.js when:**
- Performance and SEO are top priority
- You have a development partner

**Choose WordPress when:**
- Budget is limited
- You want to manage content yourself without help
- Fast launch is needed
