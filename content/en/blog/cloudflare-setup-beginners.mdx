Cloudflare is one of the most powerful free tools to make your website faster and more secure. In this guide, we take you step by step through the setup and configuration.

## What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a service that sits between your visitors and your server. It offers:

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Your content is cached worldwide
- **DDoS Protection:** Attacks are automatically blocked
- **SSL Certificate:** Free HTTPS for your website
- **Performance:** Optimizations for faster load times
- **Security:** Firewall and bot protection

### How Does It Work?

```
Visitor → Cloudflare → Your Server
              ↓
       Cache, Security, Optimization
```

Cloudflare intercepts all traffic to your site, filters malicious traffic, serves cached content where possible, and only forwards legitimate requests to your server.

## Creating an Account

### Step 1: Register

1. Go to cloudflare.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter your email address and password
4. Confirm your email

### Step 2: Add Site

1. Click "Add a Site"
2. Enter your domain name (without www)
3. Select the Free plan (or paid if you want)
4. Cloudflare scans your current DNS records

### Step 3: Verify DNS Records

Cloudflare imports your current DNS records. Check:

- [ ] All records have been imported
- [ ] A records point to correct IP
- [ ] MX records for email are correct
- [ ] Any subdomains are present

**Orange cloud = Traffic goes through Cloudflare (proxied)**
**Gray cloud = Direct to server (DNS only)**

### Step 4: Change Nameservers

Cloudflare gives you two nameservers, for example:
```
adam.ns.cloudflare.com
bella.ns.cloudflare.com
```

**At your domain registrar:**
1. Log in to your domain provider
2. Go to DNS settings
3. Change nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers
4. Wait for propagation (up to 24 hours, usually faster)

**Note:** After changing, you manage DNS entirely through Cloudflare.

## Basic Configuration

### SSL/TLS Settings

**Go to:** SSL/TLS → Overview

**Encryption mode choices:**

| Mode | Description | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Off | No encryption | Never |
| Flexible | HTTPS to Cloudflare, HTTP to server | Temporary solution |
| Full | HTTPS end-to-end, self-signed cert OK | If you have your own SSL |
| Full (Strict) | HTTPS end-to-end, valid cert required | Recommended |

**Recommendation:** Full (Strict) with a valid SSL certificate on your server.

**Edge Certificates:**
- Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
- Enable "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"

### Caching Settings

**Go to:** Caching → Configuration

**Caching Level:**
- Standard: Recommended for most sites
- Aggressive: More caching, check if dynamic content works correctly

**Browser Cache TTL:**
- Respect Existing Headers: Use settings from your server
- Or choose a specific time (4 hours is a good starting point)

**Purge Cache:**
When you make changes that are not visible:
1. Go to Caching → Configuration
2. Click "Purge Everything"
3. Or purge specific URLs

### Speed Optimizations

**Go to:** Speed → Optimization

**Auto Minify:**
- JavaScript: On
- CSS: On
- HTML: On

**Brotli:**
- Enable for better compression

**Rocket Loader (experimental):**
- Test well, can cause JavaScript problems
- Disable if you experience issues

**Polish (Pro plan):**
- Automatic image optimization
- WebP conversion

### Firewall Settings

**Go to:** Security → WAF

**Security Level:**
- Essentially Off: No protection
- Low: Only worst threats
- Medium: Recommended
- High: Stricter, can give false positives
- I'm Under Attack: Only during active attack

**Bot Fight Mode:**
- Enable for basic bot protection

**Browser Integrity Check:**
- Enable (checks for suspicious headers)

## DNS Management

### Adding Records

**Go to:** DNS → Records

**A Record (IPv4):**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (for root domain) or subdomain
IPv4 address: Your server IP
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
```

**CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: example.com
Proxy status: Proxied
```

**MX Record (email):**
```
Type: MX
Name: @
Mail server: mail.provider.com
Priority: 10
Proxy status: DNS only (gray - MUST for email)
```

**TXT Record (verification, SPF, etc.):**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Content: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

### Important Tips

1. **Email records:** Never proxied, always DNS only
2. **Subdomains:** Add each subdomain separately
3. **TTL:** Auto is fine for most cases
4. **Proxy:** Enable for CDN/security benefits

## Page Rules

Page Rules let you set specific behavior per URL pattern.

**Go to:** Rules → Page Rules

### Useful Page Rules

**Cache everything for static assets:**
```
URL: *example.com/wp-content/*
Setting: Cache Level → Cache Everything
Setting: Edge Cache TTL → a month
```

**Bypass cache for admin:**
```
URL: *example.com/wp-admin/*
Setting: Cache Level → Bypass
Setting: Security Level → High
```

**Redirect www to non-www:**
```
URL: www.example.com/*
Setting: Forwarding URL (301)
Target: https://example.com/$1
```

**Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:**
```
URL: http://*example.com/*
Setting: Always Use HTTPS
```

**Note:** Free plan has 3 page rules. Priority: from top to bottom.

## Advanced Features

### Firewall Rules

**Go to:** Security → WAF → Custom rules

**Example: Block specific countries:**
```
(ip.geoip.country in {"CN" "RU"})
Action: Block
```

**Example: Protect login page:**
```
(http.request.uri.path contains "/wp-login.php")
Action: Managed Challenge
```

### Rate Limiting

**Go to:** Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules

Limit the number of requests per IP:
```
If: URI Path contains /api/
Rate: 100 requests per 10 seconds
Action: Block
```

### Workers (advanced)

Cloudflare Workers are serverless functions at the edge.

**Use cases:**
- Custom redirects
- A/B testing
- Header modification
- Edge-side includes

**Go to:** Workers & Pages

## WordPress Specific Setup

### Recommended Settings

**SSL/TLS:**
- Full (Strict) with SSL on server

**Caching:**
- Caching Level: Standard
- Browser Cache TTL: 4 hours

**Speed:**
- Auto Minify: All on
- Brotli: On
- Rocket Loader: Test first, often off

**Page Rules:**
```
1. *example.com/wp-admin/*
   - Cache Level: Bypass
   - Security Level: High

2. *example.com/wp-content/*
   - Cache Level: Cache Everything
   - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month
```

### WordPress Plugin

Install the official Cloudflare plugin:
1. Plugins → Add New
2. Search for "Cloudflare"
3. Install and activate
4. Connect with your Cloudflare account

**Features:**
- Automatic cache purge on changes
- Apply optimal settings
- Activate APO (Automatic Platform Optimization)

### APO (Pro feature)

Automatic Platform Optimization for WordPress:
- Caches complete HTML pages
- Drastic speed improvement
- $5/month extra or included with Pro

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Accessible

**Check:**
1. Are nameservers correctly changed?
2. Is propagation complete? (check via whatsmydns.net)
3. Does the A record point to the correct IP?
4. Is your server accessible? (test via DNS only mode)

**Temporary fix:**
Set Proxy status to DNS only (gray cloud) to bypass Cloudflare.

### SSL Errors

**Error 525: SSL Handshake Failed**
- Your server does not have a valid SSL certificate
- Fix: Install SSL on server or use Flexible mode temporarily

**Error 526: Invalid SSL Certificate**
- SSL certificate on server is invalid/expired
- Fix: Renew or install valid certificate

**Redirect Loop:**
- Cloudflare and server both redirect to HTTPS
- Fix: Disable SSL redirect on server or use Full mode

### Cache Problems

**Changes not visible:**
1. Purge cache in Cloudflare
2. Clear browser cache
3. Test in incognito mode
4. Check page rules that force caching

**Dynamic content cached:**
- Add query string: ?nocache=1
- Create page rule to bypass
- Use Cache-Control headers

### Performance Problems

**Site slow via Cloudflare:**
1. Check if origin server is fast (bypass Cloudflare to test)
2. Review Rocket Loader (disable if JavaScript problems)
3. Check for large non-cached resources
4. Analyze with Browser DevTools

## Best Practices

### Security

- [ ] SSL on Full (Strict) with valid cert
- [ ] Security Level on Medium
- [ ] Bot Fight Mode on
- [ ] Firewall rules for admin pages
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for Cloudflare account

### Performance

- [ ] Auto Minify on for JS, CSS, HTML
- [ ] Brotli compression on

1. Create account
2. Add site
3. Change nameservers
4. Configure basic settings

Start with the standard settings and optimize as you go. Most problems come from too aggressive cache settings or SSL misconfiguration.
