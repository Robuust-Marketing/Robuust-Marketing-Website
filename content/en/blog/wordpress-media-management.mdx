**Title:**
The name of the file (visible in admin).

Text that can be displayed below the image.

**Alt text:**
Description for accessibility and SEO. **Always fill this in!**

**Description:**
Longer description (rarely used).

**File URL:**
Direct link to the file.

WordPress has basic image editing features:

1. Click on an image
2. Click **Edit Image** below the preview

**Available options:**

**Crop:**

2. Click the crop icon
3. Or enter exact ratios (16:9, 4:3, etc.)

**Rotate:**
- 90 degrees left
- 90 degrees right

**Flip:**

- Vertical

**Scale:**
1. Click "Scale Image"
2. Enter new dimensions
3. Proportions are maintained

**Important:** Edits are applied to:
- All sizes

- Everything except thumbnail

### Save Changes

- **Save**: Overwrites the original
- **Save as new**: Creates a copy

## Image Sizes

WordPress automatically creates multiple sizes of each upload:

### Default Sizes

- **Thumbnail**: 150 x 150 pixels (cropped)
- **Medium**: Max 300 x 300 pixels
- **Large**: Max 1024 x 1024 pixels
- **Full**: Original size

### Adjust Sizes

1. Go to **Settings** > **Media**
2. Adjust the pixel values
3. New uploads will get these sizes

**Note:** Existing images won't be adjusted. Use the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin to update those.

### Extra Sizes from Themes

Your theme may add extra sizes (e.g., for headers or portfolios). Check the theme documentation.

## Optimizing Images

Large images make your site slow. Optimize for speed.

### Before Uploading

**Choose format:**
- **JPEG**: Photos (good compression)
- **PNG**: Images with transparency
- **WebP**: Modern option (best compression)
- **SVG**: Icons and logos (infinitely scalable)

**Adjust dimensions:**
Don't upload larger than needed. If your site displays max 1200px wide, don't upload 4000px images.

**Compress:**
Use tools before upload:
- TinyPNG/TinyJPG (online)
- ImageOptim (Mac)
- Squoosh (online, Google)

### After Uploading (with plugins)

**Recommended plugins:**
- ShortPixel
- Imagify
- Smush

These compress automatically on upload and can bulk-optimize existing images.

## Replacing Files

### With Plugin (recommended)

**Enable Media Replace** plugin:

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Go to the media library
3. Click on the file
4. Click **Upload a new file**
5. Choose:
   - Replace the file (same name)
   - Replace and update links

### Manually

1. Upload the new file
2. Edit all pages/posts where the old file is used
3. Replace the image blocks
4. Delete the old file

This is time-consuming - better to use the plugin.

## Deleting Files

### Delete Single File

1. Click on the file
2. Click **Delete Permanently** at the bottom
3. Confirm

**Note:** First check if the file is being used somewhere!

### Bulk Delete

1. Click **Bulk Select** at the top
2. Select multiple files
3. Click **Delete Permanently**

### Find Unused Media

With **Media Cleaner** plugin:

1. Scans your media library
2. Finds files not used anywhere
3. Delete safely in bulk

**Always make a backup first!**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Increase maximum upload size?**
This depends on your hosting. Options:
- Ask your host to increase the limit
- Adjust php.ini (if you have access)
- Use "Big File Uploads" plugin

**Can I customize the upload folder structure?**

4. **Clean up regularly** - delete unused files

5. **Make backups** before bulk-deleting

6. **Use folders** (with plugin) for large media libraries
