Plan your content in advance:

| Day | Platform | Content type | Topic |
|-----|----------|--------------|-------|
| Mon | LinkedIn | Article | Industry insight |
| Tue | Instagram | Reel | Tips |
| Wed | Facebook | Post | Customer story |

## Common Mistakes

### 1. No Strategy

"Just posting something" does not work. You need:
- Clear goals
- Target audience insight
- Content planning
- Consistency

### 2. Only Broadcasting

Social media is not an advertising billboard:
- Engage in conversation
- Respond to comments
- Ask questions
- Listen to feedback

### 3. On All Platforms at Once

Better to be good on 2 platforms than mediocre on 5:
- Choose where your target audience is
- Focus your energy
- Build expertise

### 4. Inconsistent Posting

Algorithms reward consistency:
- Plan content in advance
- Use scheduling tools
- Create content batches

### 5. No Patience

Social media growth takes time:
- Do not expect instant results
- Build step by step
- Focus on quality over quantity

## Social Media Advertising

Organic reach is limited. Advertising amplifies your results.

### When to Advertise?

- You have proven content (organic engagement)
- You want to grow faster
- You have a specific campaign
- You are targeting a new audience

### Types of Advertisements

| Type | Goal | Suitable for |
|------|------|--------------|
| Awareness | Increase reach | New brands |
| Traffic | Website visits | Blog content |
| Engagement | Interaction | Community building |
| Leads | Contact details | B2B, services |
| Conversions | Purchases | E-commerce |

### Budget Estimate

**Starting budget:** EUR 500-1,000/month per platform

**Rule of thumb:**
- EUR 5-15 per 1,000 impressions
- EUR 0.50-2.00 per click
- EUR 5-50 per lead (depending on industry)

## Getting Started

### Do It Yourself

**Advantages:**
- Low costs

- Quick decisions

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming
- Learning curve
- Risk of inconsistency

### Outsource

**Advantages:**
- Professional content

## Conclusion

Social media is no longer optional for businesses. It is where your customers are, where conversations take place, and where brand preference is built.

**Key takeaways:**
