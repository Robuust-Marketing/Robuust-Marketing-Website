## Understanding the Instagram Algorithm

### How It Works

The algorithm determines what users see based on:

1. **Interest:** Interaction with similar content
2. **Relationship:** How much you interact with an account
3. **Timing:** Recent posts get priority
4. **Frequency:** How often someone opens the app
5. **Following list:** More followers = more competition

### Algorithm Optimization

**Do's:**
- Post when your target audience is active
- Respond quickly to comments
- Use all features (posts, reels, stories)
- Encourage saves and shares

**Don'ts:**
- Use engagement pods
- Place hashtags in comments (no longer matters)
- Recycle the same content

## Increasing Engagement

**Respond actively:**
- Answer all comments within 1 hour
- Ask follow-up questions
- Like comments from others

**Reach out to others:**
- Comment on posts in your niche
- Share user-generated content
- Engage with customers and followers

### Call-to-Actions

Tell people what to do:

- "Save this for later"
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"
- "Share in your story"
- "Link in bio for more"

## Instagram Shopping

80% value, 20% promotion. Nobody follows an advertising channel.

### 4. Ignoring Hashtags

Good hashtags = free reach. Do your research.

### 5. No Interaction

Social media is social. Respond, like, engage.
