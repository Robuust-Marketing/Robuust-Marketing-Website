Web hosting is the backbone of every website. Without good hosting, your website can be slow, unreliable, or even unreachable. In this guide, we explain everything you need to know to make the right hosting choice.

## What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is the service that makes your website available on the internet. You rent space on a server where your website files are stored and served to visitors.

### How Does It Work?

1. Visitor types your domain name in the browser
2. DNS translates the domain name to an IP address
3. Browser connects to the hosting server
4. Server sends your website files to the visitor
5. Browser displays the website
