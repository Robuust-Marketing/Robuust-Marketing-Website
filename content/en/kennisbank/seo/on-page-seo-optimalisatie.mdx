On-page SEO encompasses all optimizations you can make directly on your website. It is what you have full control over. In this guide, we cover all aspects of on-page optimization.

## What is On-Page SEO?

On-page SEO includes all optimizations on your own pages:

- Content optimization
- HTML elements (titles, meta tags)
- Internal linking
- URL structure
- Image optimization

**Difference from off-page SEO:** Off-page concerns external factors such as backlinks and social signals.

## Title Tags

The title tag is the most important on-page SEO element.

### Where Does the Title Appear?

- In the browser tab
- In search results as the clickable heading
- When sharing on social media

### Best Practices

**Length:** 50-60 characters (Google truncates at ~60)

**Structure:**
```
Primary Keyword - Secondary Keyword | Brand
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ Web Design The Hague | Professional Websites | Robuust
✓ SEO Tips for Beginners: Complete Guide [2025]
✗ Home | Robuust Marketing
✗ Welcome to our website about web design and development
```

### Title Tag Checklist

- [ ] Primary keyword at the beginning
- [ ] Unique per page
- [ ] Maximum 60 characters
- [ ] Attractive to click
- [ ] Brand name included

## Meta Descriptions

The meta description is your "advertisement" in search results.

### Where Does It Appear?

Below the title in search results. Google can override this with its own text.

### Best Practices

**Length:** 150-160 characters

**Elements:**
- Relevant keywords (appear bold)
- Call-to-action
- Unique selling point
- Urgency or benefit

**Examples:**
```
✓ Professional web design in The Hague. Fast, SEO-friendly websites
  for SMBs. Free consultation. Check out our portfolio!

✗ Robuust Marketing is a web design agency based in The Hague that
  creates websites for businesses.
```

### Meta Description Checklist

- [ ] Including target keyword
- [ ] Call-to-action present
- [ ] Unique per page
- [ ] Maximum 160 characters
- [ ] Compelling and clickworthy

## Heading Structure (H1-H6)

Headings provide structure to your content and help search engines understand what the page is about.

### H1 Tag

**Rules:**
- Only one H1 per page
- Contains primary keyword
- Describes the main content
- Unique per page

**Example:**

`Web Design The Hague: Professional Websites for Your Business`

### H2-H6 Hierarchy

Use headings as an outline:

```
H1: Web Design The Hague
├── H2: Our Web Design Services
│   ├── H3: Business Websites
│   ├── H3: E-commerce
│   └── H3: WordPress Development
├── H2: Why Choose Us?
│   ├── H3: Experience
│   └── H3: Results
└── H2: Contact Us
```

### Heading Tips

- Use keywords in H2s
- Make headings scannable
- Do not skip levels (H1 → H3 is wrong)
- Not too many H2s (5-8 is good)

## Content Optimization

### Content Length

**No fixed rule, but:**
- Thin content (&lt;300 words) rarely ranks well
- In-depth content (1500+ words) often ranks better
- Quality > Quantity

### Keyword Placement

**Where to include keywords:**
- Title tag
- H1 heading
- First 100 words
- H2 headings (some of them)
- Image alt tags
- URL
- Meta description

**Keyword density:** There is no ideal percentage. Write naturally.

### LSI Keywords

Latent Semantic Indexing keywords are related terms:

**Primary keyword:** web design
**LSI keywords:** website development, web developer, responsive design, UX design

Google understands context through related terms.

### Content Structure

**For readability:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points and lists
- Subheadings to break up content
- Visual elements

**For SEO:**
- Answer the search query directly
- Important information at the top
- Clear conclusion

### E-E-A-T Signals

Google values Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust:

**Experience:**
- Share your own experiences
- Case studies
- Practical examples

**Expertise:**
- Author bios
- Mention credentials
- Demonstrate deep knowledge

**Authoritativeness:**
- Cite sources
- Link to authoritative sites
- Earn backlinks

**Trust:**
- About us page
- Contact information
- Privacy policy
- Reviews/testimonials

## URL Optimization

### URL Best Practices

**Good:**
```
/services/web-design
/blog/seo-tips-beginners
/portfolio/website-company-x
```

**Bad:**
```
/page.php?id=123
/services-and-products-we-offer/web-design-services
/Blog/SEO-Tips
```

### URL Checklist

- [ ] Short and descriptive
- [ ] Keyword included
- [ ] Lowercase
- [ ] Hyphens as separators
- [ ] No stop words (the, a, an)
- [ ] No special characters

## Image Optimization

### Alt Text

Alt text describes images for:
- Search engines
- Screen readers (accessibility)
- When images do not load

**Examples:**

- ✓ alt="Modern web design for restaurant website"
- ✓ alt="Robuust Marketing team working together"
- ✗ alt="image1.jpg"
- ✗ alt="web design web design web design the hague"
- ✗ alt="" (empty)

### File Names

**Good:**
```
web-design-portfolio-restaurant.webp
team-robuust-marketing.jpg
```

**Bad:**
```
IMG_1234.jpg
screenshot-2024-01-15.png
```

### Image Compression

- Serve correct dimensions
- Balance quality vs file size

### Image Checklist
