React is the most widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this guide, we explain what React is and why it matters for modern websites.

## What is React?

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook (now Meta). It is used to build interactive user interfaces.

### The Core of React: Components

React works with "components" - reusable building blocks for your website. Think of LEGO: you build complex structures from simple, reusable parts.

**Example of a component:**
A website header is a component that consists of:
- Logo (sub-component)
- Navigation menu (sub-component)
- Contact button (sub-component)

This structure makes websites:
- **Maintainable**: Change one component, all instances are updated
- **Consistent**: The same button looks identical everywhere
- **Testable**: Each part can be tested separately

## Why React is Popular

### 1. Performance through Virtual DOM

React uses a "Virtual DOM" - a lightweight copy of the page in memory. When something changes:

1. React calculates the change in the Virtual DOM
2. Only the actual changes are sent to the browser
3. The page updates lightning fast

**Result:** Faster, smoother websites.

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

```
Website
├── Header
│   ├── Logo
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── SearchBar
├── MainContent
│   ├── Hero
│   ├── Features
│   └── Testimonials
└── Footer
    ├── Links
    └── ContactInfo
```

This structure makes it easy to:
- Reuse components
- Have teams work in parallel
- Organize code

### 3. Enormous Ecosystem

React has a massive community with:
- Thousands of open-source libraries
- Extensive documentation
- Active forums and support
- Constant improvements

### 4. Used by Major Companies

React is used by:
- Facebook & Instagram
- Netflix
- Airbnb
- Uber
- Twitter

This means it:
- Is proven at scale
- Is actively maintained
- Will not disappear anytime soon

## React vs Other Frameworks

### React vs Vue

**React:**
- Larger community
- More job opportunities
- More flexible, but steeper learning curve

**Vue:**
- Easier to learn
- Good documentation
- Popular in Asia

### React vs Angular

**React:**
- Library (more flexible)
- Faster to learn
- Smaller initial footprint

**Angular:**
- Complete framework
- More built-in features
- Stricter structure

### Our Choice

At Robuust Marketing, we choose React (via Next.js) because:
- Excellent performance
- Large talent pool
- Best SEO capabilities with Next.js
- Scalable for any project

## Terms You Should Know

### JSX

JSX is the syntax that React uses - a mix of JavaScript and HTML:

```jsx
function WelcomeMessage({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Great to have you here.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This makes it intuitive to describe UI.

### Props

Props are properties that you pass to components:

```jsx
<Button color="blue" size="large">
  Click here
</Button>
```

The Button component receives `color` and `size` as props.

### State

State is data that can change over time:
- Form input
- Whether a menu is open/closed
- How many items are in a shopping cart

When state changes, React automatically updates the UI.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that give your component extra capabilities:
- `useState`: For changeable data
- `useEffect`: For side effects (API calls, etc.)
- `useContext`: For shared data

## What Does This Mean for Your Website?

### Benefits of React Websites

**Performance:**
- Faster interactions
- Smooth animations
- Efficient data loading

**User Experience:**
- App-like experience
- No page refreshes needed
- Immediate feedback

**Maintenance:**
- Easier to modify
- Fewer bugs due to component structure
- Better testability

**Future-proof:**
- Actively maintained
- Growing ecosystem
- Industry standard

### Potential Drawbacks

**Initial complexity:**
- Requires experienced developers
- Higher initial budget

**Overhead for simple sites:**
- Overkill for a simple brochure site
- Extra build step required

## When is React the Right Choice?

### Use React

- Interactive web applications
- E-commerce with dynamic features
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Websites with lots of state management
- Projects with ongoing development

### No React Needed

- Simple informational websites (5-10 pages)
- Pure content/blog sites without interaction
- Very limited budget projects
- No development resources available

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is React free?**
Yes, React is completely open-source and free to use.

**Do I need to learn React?**
If you are not a developer, you do not need to learn React. However, understand what it can do so you can make the right choices for your website.

**Can I migrate my existing site to React?**
Yes, but it is usually better to rebuild than to migrate. Contact us for advice.

**Does React work with WordPress?**
Yes, via headless WordPress. You use WordPress for content and React for the frontend.

**How long does it take to build a React website?**
This depends on the complexity. A simple website takes a few weeks, more complex projects take longer.

## Conclusion

React is the industry standard for modern web development. It offers superior performance, maintainable code, and a great user experience.

Not every project needs React, but for websites where performance, scalability, and interactivity are important, it is the best choice.
